Chapter 08.
Making Target dependencies build.

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:11,005
JC: So in order for that to work, we just need to....

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,588
The second target has been
given its dependencies as input,

4
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:21,977
So we should just be able
to tell them to build themselves.

5
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:28,388
So if we go back into our target class then build.

6
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:32,960
And we've got this dependencies
thing that we've not stored.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,537
[Silence]

8
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:45,211
So build could call update or...

9
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:50,114
Not necessarily going to update them,
I'm going to make sure they're up to date.

10
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:58,034
ensure-updated-dependencies

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,297
And then let's inaud extract...
call build inaud build self.

12
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:12,674
So build is now a sort of sequence of high level
things you need to do, and this is how to do each one.

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,662
[Silence]

14
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:26,457
We have def ensure_updated_dependencies.

15
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,971
So we should be able to go in
and say dependencies each build.

16
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:38,971
And they will build themselves.

17
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,371
These things here, which are
primary resources we already created,

18
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,554
they don't have any build
instructions and should work OK.

19
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,017
This is why I made it so it was
OK to have no instructions,

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,000
because you need to be able to
model things that already exist.

21
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,291
This should go off and tell file a and b
to build themselves, which will do nothing.

22
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:04,514
And then this will tell the first
target and file c to build themselves.

23
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:10,330
The first target will run this command here and
once those are done, run this command here.

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,657
And everything should be OK.

25
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,400
It works. Hurrah!
TS: Amazing!

26
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,794
JC: Right, so we've got an integration test
and all that we've changed to do that

27
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:29,714
is quite a lot of things. (Laughter)

28
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:38,068
I don't know if all these unit tests should
be on the build method, or on build_self.

29
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:44,480
I don't want to specify the
implementation of target

30
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:48,148
but I want to specify it's
relationship with other things.

31
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:56,354
The important thing is when you build one target, it
will tell those dependencies to build themselves.

32
00:02:56,377 --> 00:03:01,645
That's the minimum abstract
thing that needs to be checked.

33
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,908
I don't want to tell it how its
private method should be organized.

34
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:14,011
It's more about, what's its interaction with other
stuff and that is that it calls build on them.

35
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:22,530
In terms of unit tests...
fakemake target_spec... so build.

36
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,990
This is all about running instructions and stuff.

37
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:29,280
But before we get to running
instructions we have dependencies.

38
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,920
I'm not sure if it makes sense to write
a test for when there are no dependencies.

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,708
These tests are already implicitly
for when there are no dependencies.

40
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:43,880
And if there are none there's no other target for
you to say that it should or should not call build on.

41
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:47,954
So let's make a test for when there are dependencies.

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,668
[Silence]

43
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,891
We can have several of them and in
this case the order shouldn't be important.

44
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:10,982
Or rather you should construct your
dependency tree so the order doesn't matter.

45
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:21,245
If c depends on a and b, but b has to happen
after a then you should just say b depends on a.

46
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,405
That will ensure that that happens first.

47
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,640
So... The first dependency is a double.

48
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,388
And the second dependency is also a double.

49
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:50,491
This does let us check that if the first dependency
fails then we don't call the second dependency.

50
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,331
That isn't really a requirement, it's
accidental because the order doesn't matter.

51
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:06,388
So we should say it should tell all
its dependencies to build themselves.

52
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:18,971
So we expect `first_dep` to receive build once.

53
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:24,125
And likewise for the `second_dep`.

54
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,571
And, what's our target here?

55
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:38,262
Our target is FakeMake::Target.new
with a pathname (that won't matter yet).

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,360
And the dependencies, second dep and no
instructions because we're not testing that here.

57
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,388
That looks OK, so when we call target build it
should tell each of the targets to build themselves.

58
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:59,348
Oops, I've lost my other shell.

59
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,428
Path again...

60
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:09,017
[Silence]

61
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:16,251
OK that looks good.

62
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:22,605
This is a good place to commit. It's a new
feature: we have dependency management.

63
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,371
Let's have a look at what we've changed.

64
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:36,468
We've added dependencies to target class and made
it so that the target will build its dependencies.

65
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,411
If you have a tree of targets
they will recursively build themselves.

66
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,365
And we've added tests for those things.

67
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:48,045
[Silence]

68
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:50,420
OK.

69
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,171
TS: I was surprised to see when you ran that unit test,

70
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,805
it looks like there was some output
on standard out during the test,

71
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:05,610
which wasn't what I expected to see.

72
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:11,851
JC: You're right we're printing the commands.

73
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:17,650
We'll still have an issue with system, because
system inherit stood out from the ruby process.

74
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,840
Cat happens to not emit any output; well it does,
but we're binding it to the files, so it's fine.

75
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:26,457
Bur we are still echoing stuff.

76
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,388
TS: But this wasn't happening before right?

77
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:31,737
When you ran the unit test before
it was just a line of green dots.

78
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,400
JC: Yes.

79
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,525
I've let these targets in the
integration tests use standard out.

80
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,451
and I can maybe stop them from doing that.

81
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:48,845
It's a bit frustrating in that I could have
used puts and set dollar stood out inaud output.

82
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:53,245
It's one of those isolation things.

83
00:07:53,337 --> 00:07:57,725
I want this thing that prints
stuff to print a black hole.

84
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,034
And I want the tests that are running the
process to still be able to talk to stood out.

85
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:13,462
We can get around that by passing
it an output like we did before.

86
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,674
Well call it stood out here to make
it a bit more clear what its' role is.

87
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:30,400
And then that can take it as an argument.
Although not all of them will need it.

88
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,640
Only the ones that run code need it.

89
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,137
[Silence]

90
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:45,691
I'm not having a very good typing day today. [Laughter]

91
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:52,251
Private method puts called for; that's interesting.

92
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:57,714
Oh! I've called it output sorry, I forgot what
I called it. It's called stood out in this test.

93
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:03,931
OK that's better, outputs gone away.
TS: Great.
