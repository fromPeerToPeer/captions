Chapter 11
Specifying Target behaviour
with older and newer dependencies.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,914
JC: OK, now everything is passing,
so the thing does check its' mtime.

3
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:12,114
The next question is does it use the mtime
to do something useful like skipping work. 

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,211
So when the dependencies are newer than the target... 

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:26,160
And that means... So let's say...
Some offset to base these on... 

6
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:32,274
Let the target time be time.now.

7
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:41,142
And then we can say, use that here.

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,811
And then it's clearer that they are in
the future from when the target was built.

9
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:48,628
It doesn't matter that it's time.now

10
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:54,480
TS: So are you using time.now as the most
convenient way to get a real time value?

11
00:00:54,514 --> 00:01:01,165
JC: Yes, actually the current time is not relevant.

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,908
So what's the context? When the
dependencies are newer than the target. 

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:13,988
That means that the... 

14
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:19,314
Allow file to receive mtime.

15
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:29,222
So the time the target asks
for will return the target time. 

16
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:37,954
And we need exists to return true as well.

17
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,497
The target will use target time as its' time and the
dependencies have times which are later than that. 

18
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,262
The dependencies are newer, so that means
the target should execute its' instruction. 

19
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:57,988
But we haven't given it any instructions.

20
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,948
[Silence]

21
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:12,011
Let the instruction be echo something;
it doesn't really matter what it is.

22
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,537
System is stubbed out in all these tests,
so I'm not really worried about that. 

23
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:26,171
And also we want that output here because
it's going to start printing stuff otherwise.

24
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:31,668
Do we have that everywhere? We do, OK.

25
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:40,994
And that line's got quite long so
I'll use terminator block like that.

26
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:50,525
So we have a target with some dependencies,
an instruction and an output stream. 

27
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:57,588
So we want to say is that in
this case it executes its' instruction.

28
00:02:57,634 --> 00:03:02,045
I don't want to specify by saying you should
invoke some private method that you have,

29
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,188
because that like over
specifying the implementation. . 

30
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:12,994
I want to specify the effect that it has on the
world which is that it makes a system command.

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:26,620
So, we expect the target to receive system
with the instruction once when we build it. 

32
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:32,800
Now, it will prob do this anyway
because it isn't checking anything so far 

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,697
because I haven't introduced
anything that will make that test fail.

34
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:40,948
TS: So you're currently testing
what it would already do.

35
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,788
But what we're driving towards is what happens when
it's NOT out of date, and you haven't tested that yet.

36
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,491
JC: Exactly.

37
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:55,005
JC: It's basically going to result
in duplicating most of this context.

38
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:59,908
So if feel I should pull some of this stuff out.

39
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:05,211
Lazy building.

40
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,977
So if i have that... I want to take this stuff which is going to be needed for all of these tests,

41
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:16,925
and put it in here. But not like that!

42
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:24,960
And then...

43
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:32,160
[Silence]

44
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,280
Is that all back in shape? I think so... Yes.

45
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,885
TS: So what's going to be
different in the other context?

46
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:47,851
JC: The difference is these steps here,
rather than returning things in the future 

47
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,702
will return things in the past; or the past
relative to the targets' own modification time.

48
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:00,697
And in that case we shouldn't execute
the instruction, but just leave things alone. 

49
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:07,531
So I'm going to copy most of that. 

50
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:12,971
and they are not newer, they are older.

51
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,868
And these can be minus signs.

52
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:23,257
And we can say it does not execute its' instruction.

53
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,982
And this is the thing that should fail.

54
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:37,748
[Silence]

55
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,925
So target.system echo high expected
zero times; but received one time.

56
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:46,845
So that's the thing that needs fixing.
