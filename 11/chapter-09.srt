00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,988
Chapter 09.
Being lazy within a build.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,788
TS: So what next?

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,902
JC: We've got dependencies so the
next thing to do... The build has to lazy.

4
00:00:13,588 --> 00:00:18,422
And once you have dependencies, and
you know what your file depends on,

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,422
you can tell if your file is up to date because you
can ask your dependencies if they're up to date.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,800
That also introduces the problem of... When a target
builds it tells all the other targets to build.

7
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:36,708
So what If multiple things
depend on the same target?

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,788
In that situation something will be told
to build multiple times, which is wasteful.

9
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:50,834
So we could write a test that says if you call build
twice on a target, it only runs its' command once.

10
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,411
That would be good.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:03,428
And we also want a test that says if you try to build
a target that's newer than the things it depends on.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,417
Then that should also not do anything.

13
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:11,748
So I think I'll deal with the first of those first.

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:22,650
So if we go back into our tests:
spec/fakemake/target_spec.

15
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:29,120
We have dealing with dependencies.

16
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,114
You don't necessarily need
dependencies for what I was just talking about.

17
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:38,342
You just want to say if you call build
twice, it should run its' instructions once.

18
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,542
So we can put that into the
case where there is an instruction.

19
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:51,490
So it only executes the instructions once do.

20
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,537
So that's essentially this test over again.

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Except that we call this twice.

22
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:05,120
This ought to fail.

23
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,994
Which it does.

24
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:14,040
One thing about this test (I'm glad
I did this); it should receive this once.

25
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:18,022
It's a side effect we care about
how many times it's called.

26
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:22,160
But rspec says it was called 2 times.

27
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:31,165
That ought to be reasonably easy to fix
if we go back into our source code.

28
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,091
If we look at build self we can
store a flag in here that says

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,868
I've been built you don't need to do anything.

30
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:44,200
So return if already built.

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,154
And then set that to true.

32
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:58,114
And then that's passing. So I think I'll commit that.
