00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,965
Chapter 10.
Checking the mtime of the Target.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,920
The other thing is they should be lazy.

3
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:15,920
So if you run the build and make no changes
then run it again nothing should happen.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,325
Builds take a long time as your project grows,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,090
especially minifying
javascript, it can get very slow.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,125
A simple way to do this is to look
at the modified times of the files,

7
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:35,897
and if any of the things that you depend on
are newer than your own file, then you rebuild.

8
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,971
Otherwise you don't.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,982
TS: Just to clarify can you talk us through...

10
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:47,954
You've already addressed one case
about unnecessary work being done.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,902
You've made some change that
ensures something doesn't get done twice.

12
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:57,417
And now you're making another change which
is also about something not being done twice,

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,782
but in a different way.

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,325
TS: So the change you've already made,

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,480
what kind of case has that dealt
with that hasn't been dealt with here?

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,360
JC: If you have a build that has say a diamond shape...
So you have the thing that you want.

17
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:20,800
And that depends on two things.
Then they both depend on one thing.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,445
So when you call build here it
will call build on these two,

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,554
and then they will both call build on that thing.

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:33,097
What I just did was I made it so that
those two builds to the same target

21
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:38,354
don't cause work to be duplicated
within the same build process.

22
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:45,211
We're now talking about
when you run your build twice.

23
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:52,320
That the second time you run it, if you haven't
changed anything, no work should need to be done.

24
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:56,777
It skips you waiting around for things
that don't need to be recompiled;

25
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,394
or whatever it is that your doing.

26
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,097
TS: OK, Cool.

27
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:06,594
JC: It's duplicate work within
one build across multiple builds.

28
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:14,914
When you have things going across multiple builds,
like multiple executions of your build tool,

29
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:17,908
you don't have that information in memory.

30
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,382
We solved the first problem by
putting a flag in memory on an object

31
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:24,640
to say don't do this again, you've already done it.

32
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,731
When you have multiple invocations of something

33
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:30,822
you have to rely on some state
that exists between processes.

34
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,222
In this case that state could be the
modified times of the files you're looking at.

35
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:39,771
That's why basing this around
files as the primary thing...

36
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:46,777
It's good because it gives you an almost
free way to check that the files are up to date.

37
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,342
TS: OK.

38
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:55,417
JC: So we have these tests for when
there's dependencies. We could also have ...

39
00:02:57,074 --> 00:03:01,017
What would we like to do here?
So this is the thing that tells the things to build...

40
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,314
Which is what we want to do.

41
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:09,485
We should then probably also say that
depending on the result of what those calls is,

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,228
what is this target going to do?

43
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,342
So if any of those calls return a time
that's higher than the time that I have,

44
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:21,405
then I should quit.

45
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:25,462
TS: What does higher than mean?

46
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:30,971
JC: (I always get this backwards
in time!). I mean later than.

47
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:33,485
You have your coffee script
file and your JavaScript file.

48
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,222
If the coffee script file was modified
later than the JavaScript file,

49
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,988
that means the JavaScript file is
out of date, so it will recompile it.

50
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:45,005
If it's the other way round
that means your JavaScript file

51
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:48,822
has presumably been generated since
the last time you modified the coffee script.

52
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,245
And you don't need to do any more work.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,817
So let's say... We can have some context inside here.

54
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:12,068
When the dependencies are newer than the target - do.

55
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,868
OK

56
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,240
So how am I going to model that?

57
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:44,857
We can say that we allow the first dependency
to receive build and return time now plus 5 minutes.

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:55,017
Likewise with the second dependency
to return time now plus 2 minutes.

59
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,411
The target itself is going to take
those times it got from the dependencies

60
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:05,988
and then compare them to what it has.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,017
And to do that it's probably going to call file.mtime.

62
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,165
TS: What does mtime mean?

63
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,880
JC: It's the modification time.

64
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,931
The unix file system; every file has
several time stamps attached to it.

65
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:23,085
And one of those time stamps
is the last time it was modified.

66
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,160
You also get the last time it was
accessed, and some other things.

67
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:30,605
When you write to a file, the file
system updates that time stamp

68
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:33,560
so you can tell the last time it was changed.

69
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,874
TS: Is this the point at which it needs the
pathname that you've been passing in all along?

70
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:45,188
JC: Yes. I introduced that quite prematurely.
This is the first time that we need it.

71
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:53,245
Maybe the first thing we should do is
assert that it checks the time of its own pathname.

72
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,268
Checks the mtime of its own file.

73
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:14,262
So we expect file to receive mtime with pathname.

74
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:23,257
I'll change that up here to
make it less of a generic name.

75
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,234
Or target pathname.

76
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:30,937
[Silence]

77
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:39,028
The result inaud sometime,
we don't really care what it is.

78
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:45,577
So when you call target.build that should happen.

79
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,617
I've just realised this test
isn't part of this context...

80
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:50,925
It doesn't need these things to be true.

81
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:53,211
So we can move that out.

82
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:57,234
TS: Is it something that
always has to happen regardless?

83
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,205
JC: Yes. I'm thinking this
through a little bit in reverse.

84
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:11,120
Thinking it's going to look at its dependencies
times and then compare them to itself.

85
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:16,240
Therefore I should write a test to say
that it asks the file system for some information

86
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,914
But I realise that wasn't part of this.

87
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:23,142
So we can check that it does this and then
given that the dependencies return some values,

88
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:25,794
that compare with what it knows about itself.

89
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,080
TS: I'm having trouble conceptualizing these
dependencies that were built in the future.

90
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:38,125
But it's relative to what you're imagining. We're
imagining the Time.now is the mtime of this target.

91
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,171
JC: Yes and I'm just doing that because hard coding
time values always ends up blowing up in my face.

92
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:48,811
You know, six months later your
build starts failing for no reason,

93
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:55,405
so I usually do them as offsets
from wherever you are right now.

94
00:07:55,577 --> 00:08:00,388
I could have put them in the past but it doesn't
make much difference, it's the relative offset.

95
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:08,640
This will fail now because we're not doing that,
we're not showing the mtime so this won't work.

96
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,680
"received unexpected message :build with (no args)"
in Target spec 28.

97
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:21,440
[Silence]

98
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,662
Oh right, it's telling those things to build.
That's fine, we just need to give them a build method.

99
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:32,400
[Silence]

100
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,537
It's only later we say that that
build method should return something.

101
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,005
It's not important what these tests return.

102
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:49,085
I'm trying to make the doubles express the minimum
interface they need to make the test work.

103
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:52,582
TS: So you didn't need to do this before because
there was only one example in this context,

104
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:56,571
and that had expectations on those doubles.

105
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:03,005
JC: Right yes. I wrote this
test down here, that stubs it.

106
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:09,691
But for this test, those don't apply
so I had to put build method up top.

107
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:17,954
Now it's failing for the right reason and
file isn't receiving mtime with the right things. 

108
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,862
So let's go and fix that.

109
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:29,337
So  to build_self, we're already returning
we're already built so that's an easy cheap check. 

110
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:35,600
If that fails we don't want to call the file system
if we know we've already built, it's a waste of some io.

111
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,977
So we'll look at the mtime. 

112
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,211
We don't need that variable to pass that test, we
just need to call File.mtime with our path name.

113
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,417
TS: So this is the piece of
state you we're talking about. 

114
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,320
We update these mtimes when we run the build. 

115
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:59,400
And then next time we run a build we can look to see
if someone else has been in and changed something.

116
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,805
JC: Yes, and you can set that explicitly yourself.
You can tell unix to set the mtime of this file to this. 

117
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,180
But it also happens implicitly
when you write to a file.

118
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,074
That's why this is the first time it's appeared so far.

119
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,108
TS: Wow.

120
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:21,497
JC: That was... Loads of things just blew up.

121
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:25,325
[Silence]

122
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:31,451
No such file or directory.

123
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,514
Most of these tests are using
file names that don't exist.

124
00:10:38,582 --> 00:10:42,434
This is the only test where we mentioned
a mock expectation on file at mtime. 

125
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:45,382
All the other tests are
actually going to be calling it. 

126
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,491
And then it will fail because you've
asked for a file that doesn't exist.

127
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:56,845
So this is another bit of system stuff
that we need to stub out in all the tests. 

128
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,468
So allow target to receive system and return true. 

129
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,577
The other targets in these tests
are doubles so that doesn't matter. 

130
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:20,640
But we're also going to allow file
to receive mtime and return time now.

131
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:24,742
Inaud for consistency.

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,582
TS: Is it important that it does
return a specific value at this stage?

133
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,817
JC: Not at this stage because we're
not using it so let's remove the .....

134
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:40,960
TS: But your imagining that at some point you
want to control the mtime that comes back from this.

135
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,062
JC: Yes. The next thing we will do is use that
value and compare it to some other things,

136
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,942
and at that point having the right
value at the right time will be important.

137
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,777
TS: And that's why you had to
come back and put return true in here

138
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,451
to make it so that stuff didn't
think that system had failed.

139
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:09,611
JC: Exactly, but on line 27 nothing is using that
value so it's probably safe to have it return nil.

140
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:18,651
So we're still getting one fail and that's
in the integration tests: for the same reason.

141
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:22,285
[Silence]

142
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:32,640
TS: Should the integration test now actually work?

143
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,651
JC: You're right, the integration test should work. 

144
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:38,285
And I shouldn't be stubbing things in
the integration test. It's using real files.

145
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:41,880
TS: So what's the problem?

146
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:45,622
JC: "No such file or directory"

147
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,737
TS: Is this the target that's trying to build 1.txt?

148
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,657
JC: Right yes, I've told the
dependencies to update themselves.

149
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,274
Then I'm saying what's the mtime of my
file; but I might not have built my file yet.

150
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,080
TS: So this is the special case when
you're running the build for the first time.

151
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,034
And this file doesn't exist yet.

152
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:11,211
JC: Exactly. It's happening
recursively so that what's going wrong.

153
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:14,982
So, it's actually the code that's wrong.

154
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:18,171
TS: I guess this is why we have integration tests.

155
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:26,880
JC: Yes. So we can check the file exists first. 

156
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,554
That's a start. 

157
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,165
Now we're back to something reasonable.

158
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:38,925
TS: So that fixed your integration test?

159
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,102
JC: Yes, but now the unit test is failing because this
is still fake pathname that doesn't exist.

160
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,314
When you call File.exists with it it won't work.

161
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:57,817
So we'll also have to stub that in the unit test. 

162
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:08,925
Which means we can, in general, bypass that
whole code path by having this return false.

163
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,194
Then we won't need to stub more things. 

164
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,320
But in the case where were doing this... 

165
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:33,600
We also need to expect file to receive
exists with target pathname and return true.

166
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,045
I could write a bunch of tests...

167
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,885
Like, if the file exists it checks the thing
or if it doesn't exist it doesn't check the thing, 

168
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,485
but it's sort of implicit.

169
00:14:41,508 --> 00:14:45,588
In that something already failed,
that made me write the file exists check.

170
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,508
So I'm not desperate about
writing those tests right now.
