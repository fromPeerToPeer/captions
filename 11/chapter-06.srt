00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,954
Chapter 06.
Raising an exception when a build step fails.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,262
JC: The thing that gets trickier about
this is when you have multiple instructions.

3
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:10,251
You want them all to be executed

4
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:13,222
but because they have side-effects you
want them done in a particular order.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,000
Specifying that with mocks
can be a bit tricky but...

6
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:23,245
One thing that we can do, which is a use-case
I've not got to yet: what if any of them fails?

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,577
So we can say something like: if the first one fails,

8
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:30,102
the second one should not be executed
and that implies that there's an ordering.

9
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:39,268
So let's do that context:
'when there are many instructions'

10
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:54,274
let the instructions be first
instruction and second instruction.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,234
Again, it doesn't matter what these are
because we're not going to execute them.

12
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:04,240
'it prints all the instructions'.

13
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:13,257
Oh no, expect output.

14
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,960
With first instruction once.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,800
And also the second instruction.

16
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:34,240
When build the target.

17
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:43,268
And we also want to execute all of the instructions.

18
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,280
That should be the target in this case.

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:02:01,451
And puts should be system when you build target.

20
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,354
I believe these will work.

21
00:02:05,268 --> 00:02:08,388
They do.
TS: Great

22
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:16,285
JC: Now we want to say
'when the first instruction fails'.

23
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:23,150
TS: So you're saying here that it doesn't matter
what order it does it, that's not testing it?

24
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,205
JC: No, rspec will not check.

25
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:30,514
Rspec doesn't expect things to be called in
the order in which you set up the mocks.

26
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,514
You could switch these lines around.

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,120
If I switch those this will still pass.

28
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:42,205
Even though that isn't what I want.

29
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:47,588
But specifying that you want
things called in a certain order is...

30
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,405
The way that I program is an uncommon use case
and is awkward to specifying using mocks.

31
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,977
But if you have something where one thing
can prevent the next thing from happening,

32
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,040
then that implies an ordering.  It's enough to
say that one thing happens before the other.

33
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:06,068
TS: And that's something else
that you want to test anyway.

34
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,417
JC: Yes you want it to abort the
build if something bad happens.

35
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:21,417
So when the first instruction fails, it
means that I'm going to allow the target

36
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:34,285
to receive system with
first argument and return nil.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,411
Which is what system returns
if the command doesn't work.

38
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:50,834
So that scenario...(I'm not going to bother with
the printing stuff, we've done that to death).

39
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:55,920
It does execute the first argument.

40
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:04,400
But it does not execute the second.

41
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:14,000
So that means we expect this... Once.

42
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,428
[Silence]

43
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:29,382
Do we need to tell it that it will
return nil? Not sure that we do.

44
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:34,960
We'll find out.

45
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:41,634
I think I've done something weird.
Oh, I've got caps lock on, sorry!

46
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:44,274
I'll copy that.

47
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:55,897
So let me find the second instructions.

48
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,605
And it's not once, It's not.

49
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,291
So let me check this over.

50
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,348
So if the target returns nil
for the first instruction,

51
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,554
it should still execute it, but not the second one.

52
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,914
This shouldn't work because I haven't
implemented anything like this yet.

53
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,851
So expect it to use a target
(that i haven't actually told it to build).

54
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:30,742
That's quite important. [laughter].

55
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,085
Target.Build

56
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,411
[Silence]

57
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:42,948
Now it's executing the second
instruction when it shouldn't.

58
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:48,411
So if we go back to our code we can
say it's going to print the instruction.

59
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:59,062
And then we could raise failed command
unless system returns something truthy.

60
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:03,005
TS: So what will system return if it's not an error?

61
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:08,320
JC: True. We can see this in the shell for a second.

62
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,965
So if you system, echo something,
it does the thing and returns true.

63
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,337
And if you ask it to run a program
that doesn't exist it returns nil.

64
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,428
TS: OK great.

65
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,422
JC: So it's quite handy for having
a high level API inaud system.

66
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,622
inaud

67
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:45,771
So make an exception and raise that
unless system returns something truthy.

68
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:56,388
TS: So you've made a decision here that you don't want
it to skip them silently, you want them to actually...

69
00:06:56,617 --> 00:07:01,394
JC: No because a build is just a sequence.

70
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,297
You turn a coffee-script file into a JavaScript file
and you need to put multiple files into a single one.

71
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:09,634
If the first step fails you can't do the second step.

72
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:15,074
And you shouldn't try
because if those files don't exist,

73
00:07:15,097 --> 00:07:19,668
like if your command uses a shell wildcard or
tries to interpolate something that doesn't exist,

74
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,554
you might end up constructing a
command that will do something dangerous.

75
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:29,440
So it really ought to check that everything
you've done so far did what you expected.

76
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,085
So we shall run that. OK so loads of things are
now not working, which is common, and fine.

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,114
So let's find out why that was.

78
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:50,102
A lot of these raised, I was not
expecting them to be raised.

79
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,131
For example, the first one, 33 lets run that.

80
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,474
It's raising,

81
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:09,371
And it's raising from build.

82
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,605
We said we're going to raise unless
system returned something truthy.

83
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:22,582
But we haven't made system
return anything, we stubbed it out.

84
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,731
TS: So that will be returning nil by default.

85
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:31,554
JC: Yes, so we should make that return true and
anywhere else we're saying it should be called.

86
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:34,514
That's a not so it doesn't matter.

87
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:43,380
TS: Earlier you said you were expecting these
to inherit the behaviour of the stuff anyway.

88
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,445
JC: That's a good point yes.

89
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,302
I think if you stub something and
then put mock expectation on it,

90
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:57,417
the thing at the top says if you call
it with anything it just returns true.

91
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,097
The mocks tend to be more specific.

92
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:03,725
Inaud not to but it doesn't matter
because it's not going to be called.

93
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,348
But here we're saying it should be called
with something and that's a different use case.

94
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,017
I believe in those situations you have
to tell it again what you want it to return.

95
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,702
That's passing, a couple are
still not passing 64 and 69.

96
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,588
[Silence]

97
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:33,702
TS: Why were they failing?

98
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:42,480
JC: I believe this will raise and it's supposed
to raise, but I'm not catching that it raises.

99
00:09:43,154 --> 00:09:50,365
I should have another test that
says it raises FailedCommand.

100
00:09:54,171 --> 00:10:06,400
Expect target.build to raise
error and FakeMake FailedCommand.

101
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,502
TS: So the problem with these tests is that
the exception was bubbling out of the tests.

102
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,165
JC: Right.

103
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,725
And then I can just rescue in here.

104
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:21,462
[Silence]

105
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:24,365
OK so that's all green again.

106
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,222
TS: Great.

107
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,850
JC: It took a while to get there,

108
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:34,788
But I think that's enough of a specification
of what the thing does about running commands.

109
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,525
We've now got a thing that can run arbitrary commands
and can do something reasonably sensible with them.

110
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,554
So I'm going to get out of here to make a commit.

111
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,245
So what have we got?

112
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:55,051
I might just move build.sh to my scratch
directory and keep that hanging around.

113
00:10:55,222 --> 00:11:03,714
So I ought to add the Gemfile things and the
example, although not everything in example.

114
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,137
There are a few things we definitely don't want.

115
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:17,040
I don't want an example bundle.js or example lib.

116
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:22,914
Nor node modules, because they
are just for running the examples.

117
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,742
I don't want scratch.

118
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,205
Inaud package either, we're
building a ruby project – although that is...

119
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:42,340
No that's metadata about the examples
and you will use it to install your node modules.

120
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:45,920
But you don't want node models... that's fine.

121
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:52,411
I'll move .js off there. So if I give that
all of this. So what do we end up with?

122
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,491
Git ignore and some gem files and some example code

123
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:59,725
and our source code and package.json and specs.

124
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,737
Which looks reasonable to me.

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,417
[Silence]

126
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,737
OK.
