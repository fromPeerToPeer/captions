00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,977
Chapter 07
Specifying dependencies.

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:08,580
JC: OK so we just committed the working target class.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,411
It can't do an awful lot just
yet, it can just run the commands.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,251
So if we go back to...

5
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:21,257
What did we have in here. My test file.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:28,925
When I was sketching this out earlier,
down here I told each of the targets to build.

7
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:32,102
They're all just isolated.

8
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:37,165
A better user interface would be to do that.

9
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:44,982
And have everything needed to
produce the final result just happen.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,960
For that sort of thing you're going to need to
know for example, what bundle.js will depend on.

11
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,251
Hello_js and complimenter_js

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:05,222
Whereas these won't depend on anything.

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,700
They are their own things.

14
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:15,885
Although they do arguably depend on their source code.

15
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:24,742
In order for the build system to be lazy
and work out if any more work needs doing, 

16
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:27,542
it will need to know about that relationship.

17
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,651
So it's probably advisable if we say... 

18
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,702
Here we have these target
objects to represent these things.

19
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:43,005
but for these source files,
we could say that they are...

20
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:56,400
For example, hello coffee is a
target new example source hello.coffee, 

21
00:01:56,457 --> 00:02:01,634
which actually depends on nothing because the
source code you wrote is not derived from anything.

22
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:08,011
And it has no build instructions and
because you wrote it it doesn't need generating. 

23
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:13,131
And then this could take that as a dependency.

24
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:17,920
And you can do the same for
complimenter, and what have you.

25
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:27,188
I'm on the fence about whether to pass
these things around as values or by name. 

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:36,914
Because, to pass this by saying
`example/src/hello.coffee`...

27
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:43,348
TS: What's the trade off there?
Why would you want to do it one way or the other?

28
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:51,965
JC: Good question, if you do them by
name you can do your target in any order. 

29
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:58,000
This can be beneficial. This is
supposed to be a declarative system. 

30
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:03,234
It can also mean that you make
dependencies on things that don't exist yet. 

31
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:11,142
So for example complimentor.js
won't exist when you start the build. 

32
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,280
The target represents something that will exist
in the future so you don't need the file to exist.

33
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:25,611
But having the pass by name means that you
can do something for example, by having patterns. 

34
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:30,514
Like if you want to say star.js
depends on star.coffee, 

35
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,605
we don't want to have to write all these
targets out by hand once the project gets large. 

36
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:42,902
So you may want to have some general
rule for how you get from one to the other.

37
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:47,840
TS: It sounds like that may
be more complicated though.

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,897
JC: Yeah, erh... We can
probably start by passing by value 

39
00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:59,554
and if it becomes a problem we can pass by name,

40
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,902
and then have those names be looked up
in something else but turned into the values.

41
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:08,240
That should be a fairly minor change to make later.

42
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:12,068
So let's do the pass by value thing.

43
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:20,217
So if we go back to our spec.

44
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,857
I already had this open
because it was in another shell.

45
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:33,040
Yes, so... This is all talking
about running instructions. 

46
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:37,142
We also want to talk about having dependencies.

47
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:44,605
So we've decided that the target is going to
have a new argument, which is its dependencies. 

48
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,091
[Silence]

49
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:11,120
That ought to run but it doesn't... Why not?

50
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,754
[James is thinking]

51
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:22,617
Oh yes, OK so the tests we need...

52
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:31,440
I need to write that properly...
Dependencies is some list.

53
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:37,200
And I like things that line up.

54
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:40,491
So that ought to be fine.

55
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:50,057
So these tests are now testing
a thing that has no dependencies.

56
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,300
Ultimately we would like to have
a target that will depend on something else, 

57
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:06,182
and if you build your target it
will also build the other thing.

58
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:14,525
Maybe this is where we get
into integration tests scenario.

59
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:20,365
Because I'm going to have two target
objects maybe writing unit tests against those.

60
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:24,982
I could write a test to say when you call
build on this call build on this other thing, 

61
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,280
but maybe that's specifying
implementation too much.

62
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:35,085
So I'm going to try and write... 

63
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:43,600
Spec/features is where I'm
going to put my generation test. 

64
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:50,697
Dependent targets spec.rb.

65
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:54,651
[Silence]

66
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:03,074
No that's not how you write specs is it?

67
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:10,628
Describe dependent targets do.

68
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:14,434
[James thinks]

69
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:26,628
Say when one target depends on another.

70
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:38,571
As something simple, I'm going to say that if you have...

71
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:42,731
what's something simple we can
do with files, just like catting them.

72
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,188
So if you have file c that is...

73
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,474
I'll write it in code, that might be a bit clearer.

74
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,194
So if we say...

75
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:05,165
Not quite sure how to phrase this yet but... 

76
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:08,182
let's say that we have...

77
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:18,480
There exists a file called a.text that
just contains an a with a new line in it.

78
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:30,148
And likewise there are some files called
b and c that have their letters in them.

79
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:33,714
[Silence]

80
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:45,325
So if there are those files,
then you have your first target.

81
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:57,748
And let's add these somewhere... Like in spec temp.

82
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,211
[Silence}

83
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:12,674
So if the first target is spec temp 1.text.

84
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:21,165
And that's new with that.

85
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:29,405
And it has no dependencies, or rather
it does have dependencies which are...

86
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,685
Sorry I got a bit side tracked. 

87
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:39,234
So file_a.

88
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:44,137
TS: So we need targets to represent these files
even though there not going to be built in any way.

89
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,817
There will be some nicer user
interface around this at some point.

90
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,200
But it makes this a bit more
complicated as far as those values, 

91
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:56,960
because you have to make values
for thing that are just primitive files.

92
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,714
TS: Whereas if you identified things by name,

93
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,434
the assumption would have been if I've named
something by name it isn't a target it's just a file.

94
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,748
JC: Yes. 

95
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:17,177
So these have no dependencies in them,
no build instructions, so they can be done like that.

96
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:21,714
That's b that's c.

97
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:29,131
So if this depends on file a and file b, 

98
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:51,142
And works by catting spec temp a.text
spec temp b.text into spec temp 1.text.

99
00:10:55,154 --> 00:11:07,451
And the second target is called second.

100
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:21,405
And that works by depending
on the first target - file c. 

101
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:32,640
Then that is going to work by taking 1.text
and c.text and putting that into the second. 

102
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:38,148
I suppose this could be our before block.

103
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:41,794
[Silence]

104
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:52,697
TS: So you haven't actually built anything yet?

105
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,131
JC: No.

106
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:14,228
If we just build the second target then we expect
file read spec temp second text to equal...

107
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:22,937
a newline, b newline, c newline.

108
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:27,154
Because everything has
been concatenated together.

109
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:30,857
[Silence]

110
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:41,890
I'm going to  make some helper functions here. 

111
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:49,531
So I've made this file helper
here, I just need to define that.

112
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:56,600
I've made this helper because I want everything
to be cleaned up automatically afterwards. 

113
00:12:57,268 --> 00:13:01,325
This helper is going to make the file
with that content and keep track of it.

114
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,725
And if there's inaud remove all of them.

115
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,531
TS: OK.

116
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:15,280
JC: So file utils has a make dir-p function.

117
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:28,700
We can make that, and then we can file open,
the path name and write content into that.

118
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,582
[Silence]

119
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,108
Then we can store the path name in there. 

120
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:46,720
[Silence]

121
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:54,102
And then there's an afterhook, we can say...

122
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,148
Spec files each do path name.

123
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:05,131
So file unlink to delete things.

124
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,354
So then we ought not to be left
with load of files that exist between tests.

125
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:17,337
and cause subsequent tests
to not do the right thing.

126
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,485
So does this say what we actually want?

127
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,880
We have 3 files and they have content.

128
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:28,068
And we've made targets for them and the first target depends on a and b 

129
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,474
and if you cat those two
files together you get 1.text.

130
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,982
The second target depends on the first target and file c 

131
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:42,308
and if you can cat those two
to make the second file, that works.

132
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,514
The way things are at the moment,
if we just run second target.build, 

133
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:53,714
it might end up throwing because
this 1. text file won't exist.

134
00:14:54,045 --> 00:15:01,462
So cat in that situation, I can't remember...
If it fails silently and returns zero or not.

135
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,057
We'll find out, but either way.. It should throw
or it shouldn't have the right content in it. 

136
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,514
A and b will be missing.

137
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:14,102
So let's have a go at running those spec features.

138
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:20,365
No variables, second target on where... 38. 

139
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:25,131
Ah yes. 

140
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,788
[Silence]

141
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,148
That's a local variable that split apart.

142
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:37,828
Just run that.

143
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,771
We've got a failed command from line
38 where we tried to build that thing.

144
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:48,148
I assume because the cat is failing.

145
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:56,034
It would be nice if that error told us what
command had failed. It would be really helpful. 

146
00:15:56,057 --> 00:16:01,154
So let's make it do that, so
we know, lib/fakemake/target.

147
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:07,257
Raise fake command.

148
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:23,371
Unless system instruction message
equals command failed with the instruction.

149
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:25,188
TS: Right.

150
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:28,742
[Silence]

151
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:34,125
JC: Raise that.

152
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,885
[Silence]

153
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,097
Command failed cat spec temp 1. So that is expected.

154
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,685
I hope those files are not hanging around in temp.

155
00:16:50,680 --> 00:17:00,228
So this knows how to clean up the files we created
with file but it doesn't know how to clean up.

156
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,137
TS: How you going to fix that?

157
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:08,502
JC: We could poke those things into the array so it knows about them but it still feels a little unclean. I accidentally made a new shell there. We could just nuke the temp directory. I think that's maybe why I put them in a directory in the first place, so you can just wipe the slate clean.
