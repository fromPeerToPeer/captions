00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:03,977
[Chapter 02: Executing a build by hand.]

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:09,165
So we have the code checked out over here.

3
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:14,940
So we've got a couple of files.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,022
I know we're going to need
coffeescript and also uglify,

5
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:23,977
so let's make a package.json
with those things in it.

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,474
[Silence]

7
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:43,234
TS: What will the package.json allow you to do?

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:51,600
JG: Package.json is what npm
the node packaging system uses.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,217
And one of its functions is
to manage your dependencies.

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,908
There are two sets of dependencies,
dependencies and dev-dependencies.

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,371
Dependencies are things that your
program uses in run time in production,

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,537
and dev-dependencies are things you use
for testing or examples, or what have you.

13
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,200
So coffeescript and uglify are
not going to be part of the tool,

14
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,051
they're things you can run with the tool.

15
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:21,565
They'll be part of the examples so I'll put them in dev.

16
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:23,497
TS: OK

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,411
JC: So save that, and if you run
npm install it should install them for you.

18
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:36,308
So that's good.

19
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:43,508
Packages that provide executables
npm puts those in `node_modules/.bin`.

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,222
And they just sit inside the project.

21
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:54,811
So we should be able to compile each
of those things into a javascript file.

22
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:59,874
And then minify them and concatenate the results.

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,634
So were going to need to do...

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,980
[James thinks]

25
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:18,610
Let's make another directory inside there and move...

26
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:25,942
Can I do it that way? We'll soon find out.

27
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:28,548
TS: Looks like it.

28
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:36,800
JC: OK so those are in source,
we'll make another directory called lib.

29
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,234
So I want to run node modules.bin with coffee...

30
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:51,497
I want to compile and put the output in example lib.

31
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,560
And compile example source
with complimenter coffee.

32
00:02:58,377 --> 00:02:59,462
TS: So what's that done?

33
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:04,354
JC: That should have compiled that
file in to the example lib.directory.

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,582
So that has showed up.

35
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:14,765
Look at example source
complimenter that has some code in it.

36
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,114
So example lib complimenter should
look the same, but in  JavaScript.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,388
That does look reasonable.

38
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,548
And then we'll do the same with the other file.

39
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:33,611
[James types]

40
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:41,325
I'll use hello.

41
00:03:41,497 --> 00:03:45,062
[Silence]

42
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,314
So that's compiled it.

43
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:55,154
So the next thing to do with those files .... [he thinks].

44
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,205
Given that one of the requirements of
the brief is that the build should be lazy,

45
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:08,582
and only do steps when they're required.

46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,891
The way that make does that is, any
intermediate results, you put in files.

47
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,297
Because  it can then check
the modified time of the files,

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,251
and if it's less recent, than any of the
inputs to that file, it will rebuild it.

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,148
So, to minify something...

50
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,108
Again, we can use inaud run uglify.

51
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:49,634
I think it's these flags.
Those flags have compress which is...

52
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,822
Let's see what the help says.

53
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,131
inaud

54
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:04,800
[Silence]

55
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:18,148
So – C enables compressor options.
You have to tell that to make it minify the file.

56
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,760
TS: Right.

57
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,542
JC: The option called m has not been found. 

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,748
It's up there... It's mangle... Which means
it will do things like shift variable names.

59
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:35,920
And – O is for output inaud file.

60
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,868
TS: So is uglify going to be responsible for concatenating these 

61
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:42,331
or does concatenation
come after the uglification?

62
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,154
JC: That's the bit I'm not sure about actually. 

63
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:52,045
Whether you can give it multiple input files
and have it write them all to the same place.

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,645
TS: It seems that the
coffeescript compiler is one to one. 

65
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
You give it one coffee script
file and one JavaScript file.

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,731
JC: Exactly. 

67
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,262
So the first line here says the usage
is that they contain multiple input files. 

68
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,954
So why don't we try to get it to do that.

69
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,822
I'll just remove those.

70
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,754
cmo example/bundle.js

71
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:23,748
example/lib/*

72
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,697
And we'll see what goes on in there.

73
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:35,222
OK that looks like it has some code in it.

74
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:43,714
It will have mangled all the names and everything
so whatever I was looking for in here...

75
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,480
It will only reduce the size of local variables,

76
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,857
because it doesn't matter
what those are externally,

77
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,971
but method name should stay the same.

78
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,970
So I think there is a say... yes inaud same method... and its got that going in if we want it.  So this looks like the output that we want to produce.
TS: Whats the trade off between concatenating and minifying them all in one step versus...
