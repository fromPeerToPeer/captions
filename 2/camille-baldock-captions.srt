00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,740
Welcome to Peer to Peer, where you
can watch our experts solve tech problems.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,200
Our guest today is Camille Baldock

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,140
who by day writes Ruby and
Java script for the British Government.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,220
And by night mentors junior
developers and teaches programming in schools.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,370
Our host is Tom Stuart.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,080
And the challenge that we set for CamI'lle is called ..

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,220
TS: So CamI'lle, would you like to
read out the problem statement ?

8
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,114
Do you know the standard poker ranking rules ?

9
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,457
CB: I do !  Which is fortunate.

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,970
CB: OK, right, so this is nice and vague !

11
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:57,914
CB: If I'm doing something like that
I need some way of knowing

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,940
this is hand A and this is hand
B and the program wI'll sort it out.

13
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,420
And I need to think of how to
tell people to tell me what their hand looks like.

14
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,110
TS: OK

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,514
The first 'off the top of my head', easy thing,

16
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:16,540
is that you have some sort of string or array.
The first 'off the top of my head', easy thing,

17
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,857
is that you have some sort of string or array.

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,370
you have an array of 5 things,

19
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,020
that says I have a 5 of Hearts and the 6 of Diamonds

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,110
I could put that in an array and
represent that as 4H5D. (4 Hearts 5 Diamonds).

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,910
Put that in an array and then two arrays.

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,050
And create the problem.
So we'll get started with that.

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,110
So, I want to switch to input code.

24
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,620
What I'm going to do is make sure
I've got a couple of things in place

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,540
Like a spec helper.
And then, we can get started.

26
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,257
The first thing I want to
do is enter some kind of array 'thing'

27
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,742
and it creates .... we'll I don't know what it creates.

28
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,800
So, if I'm going to be comparing hands

29
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,250
A hand has several cards in it, and I need

30
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,110
some way to represent what a card is

31
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,770
and a hand that has several cards in it.

32
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,850
And then I want to be taking the hand,
and taking the other hand object

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,570
and then somehow comparing them.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So the first thing I want
to have in place is some kind of

35
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,480
hand object and some kind
of card object in which I can put 'things'

36
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,280
So the first thing I want to do is .....

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,020
I have an array that says 5H and 6 Diamond

38
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,600
And in the other hand - and this is my hand object with those

39
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,280
card 'things' inside it.

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,800
So we wI'll start with that I think.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,340
TS: Are you talking about an array of strings?

42
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,180
CB: As an input or .....
TS: Yes

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,110
CB: Yes.  I'm not really
concerned about that at the moment

44
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,510
I don't think it matters that much

45
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,200
Since I don't want to keep
them as an array of strings

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,571
but do interesting things afterwards so

47
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:22,342
I don't think it matters that much.

48
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:25,057
TS: So this is just going to be a serialisation format.

49
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:28,028
CB: Yes, a hand parser type thing. Let's call it that.

50
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,000
So, if I have a hand parser 'thing'.

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,600
Ok, so this is the 'I cant type moment'. (laughter)

52
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,970
So if we have some kind
of object called hand parser

53
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,170
It probably should parses
the array of strings and represent

54
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,680
the cards (this is quite
verbose), but let's get to that.

55
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,710
Actually this is going to
fail so how about we run this

56
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,200
And this is not very happy and inaudible

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,480
Yes, this is my first failure - here we go !

58
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,280
So I'm going to have to inaudible

59
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,200
It's getting somewhere.
I need to create that file in there.

60
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,770
And let's create a  parser
that does absolutely nothing.

61
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,620
But that should make my test happy enough,

62
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,710
unless I don't require it, obviously

63
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,140
inaudible - know where to look

64
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,857
So let's give that a try....
OK zero example zero failures.

65
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,340
So far so good.

66
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,220
What I probably want to do is ....

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,770
If I create a hand parser
and I give it the array of cards.

68
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,740
Of string things that wI'll represent cards then

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,220
on the other hand I want
to check what the output of that is.

70
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,650
So the subject is hand parser, so if we have

71
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,080
Describe cards.

72
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,800
I create hand parser and then
I hopefully have some kind of thing

73
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,250
That says pars and
it wI'll take the array of cards

74
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,540
Which I need to define.

75
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,400
Let's have a look at how
I'm going to put those cards in.

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,800
So we can have those as 5 Hearts 6 of Diamonds

77
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,970
That's not an array (Laughter).

78
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,250
Choose the cards.

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,228
TS: King, Queen, Ace, I'm not an expert.

80
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,257
CB: King of Spades,
what's the other suit?

81
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,510
Clubs, that's the one

82
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,370
So Queen of Clubs, and then we can have

83
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,400
let's have an annoying card in there.

84
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,480
Just so we have a bit of fun.

85
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,228
Which is Ace.

86
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,770
let's keep Ace as one
and see where that takes us.

87
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,400
I reckon that matters somehow.

88
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,450
But I have no idea, so we shall see.

89
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,050
And this should give me some kind of 'thing'.

90
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,450
This is already going to fail

91
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,480
so I'm not even going
to put an expectation in there

92
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,910
I'm going to go ahead and
run my tests and this should fail nicely.

93
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,510
I don't have method parts, so ........

94
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,280
I have a group of cards that
takes an array of things - cards.

95
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,650
It's not these things.

96
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,200
we'll - this test tests nothing.

97
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,370
But at least it's not giving error any more

98
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,970
On the other hand - I want it to be a hand and ....

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,650
I want this to be some
kind of hand 'object' type of thing.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,450
So, I want to create a hand object type of thing.

101
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,080
TS: OK.

102
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,080
Oh, how do we even do this in our spec.

103
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,740
I don't want to do something like this, right.

104
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,020
How do you get a thing and check the class of it.

105
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,571
so, expect (hand.cards.count)

106
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,310
2 or 5 for example,

107
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,370
this doesn't test that anymore
so let's rewire this thing a little bit.

108
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,285
We'll just give this 5 cards

109
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:55,140
and it returns back a hand of cards.

110
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,340
So here we want it to have exactly
the same number of things that we have.

111
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,940
I'm going to gloss over the issue

112
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,600
and give it an array of cards that only has 4 cards

113
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,970
if it falls over, let's just

114
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,310
not go there for now,
we'll just assume that our users

115
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,685
are going to put correct the things in there.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,310
TS: OK.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,680
So yes let's just start with that,
this has already failed quite nicely.

118
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,940
Right, excellent, so

119
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,228
This needs to return a thing that quacks dot cards.

120
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,370
TS: OK.

121
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,620
CB: Look at me failing,
that's sublime, beautiful. (laughter)

122
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,940
OK, so if it has that then ......

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,600
This should complain for different reasons now.

124
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,480
No shortcut, OK

125
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,050
inaudible parser hand ... so far so good.

126
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,280
This doesn't know what hand
it is so let's quickly acquire it.

127
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,970
And now back to our tests.

128
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,220
And if I make the count, it has nothing in it.

129
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,020
This should fail for a slightly nicer reason now.

130
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,650
So here we have an
array that has nothing in it.

131
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,710
And we should have 5 things, inaudible

132
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,420
it's about time!

133
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,340
So if we have an array of cards and it

134
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,080
has 5 things, then I want to do is create a hand

135
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,020
with some cards in it.

136
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,680
So if we have some 'thing' that

137
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,800
takes the array of cards which is essentially

138
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,370
an array of string cards,
or however you want to call that.

139
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,110
And I want it to basically
find that string of cards and

140
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,650
say, make me a string
object type 'thing'.

141
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,970
TS: Right.

142
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,480
and then eventually I'll want to inaud hand.

143
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,620
but one thing at a time.

144
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,971
OK, so that can live here.

145
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,620
So if I  have make a card thing,

146
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,370
this is going to move to card object later.

147
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,880
Let's get to that in a second.

148
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,280
TS: OK.

149
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,680
I don't like the interface
of this, it is quite unnatural.

150
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,850
I quite like the fact that my parsing object

151
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,510
is going to sit somewhere else.

152
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,510
I don't want to have to do
crazy inaud and things like that

153
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:01,800
as part of a thing that is

154
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,457
supposed to be comparing cards.

155
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:06,220
But, at the same time,
like here, I'm creating a new card

156
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,850
TS: So why are you
approaching it in this particular way ?

157
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:13,485
if your saying you don't
want this method to be here,

158
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:15,570
why are you putting it here at the moment ?

159
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,400
CB: I'm not quite sure how much logic

160
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,650
what my card.new type
method should be, setting.

161
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,400
TS: OK

162
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,800
CB: In a perfect world, I would
like it to say 'if it's a 5 of Diamond' it takes

163
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
card.move 5 and a
diamond symbol type thing.

164
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,850
So I want a tiny bit of
pre-processing before hand.

165
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,970
To check that there are
two things in this string

166
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,080
H maps to Hearts, and something like that.

167
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,540
TS: Fine

168
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,480
So this is where I want
this to live. I'm not quite sure yet.

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,510
TS: So your expecting later on

170
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,540
that your going to have a better idea of

171
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,000
what's going on here.
CB: Yes.

172
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,200
TS: Ok let's see what happens.

173
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,680
This is a thing, and it takes a card string.

174
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,850
And, if I remember rightly,

175
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,770
my card string has 5 H or something like that.

176
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,620
So what I'm going to do is create card.new

177
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,570
and I'm taking card string zero cards

178
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,710
card string one but actually not.

179
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,740
How do I want my cards to look,
how do I want them to quack.

180
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,600
It's going to be easier
for me as a human, to have

181
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,420
my suits (as in Hearts/Diamonds etc)

182
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,880
written out in plain letters
not as H and D etc.

183
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,200
TS: OK

184
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,250
I just want to do a very quick pre-parsing

185
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,110
if this is H then just
give me a Heart symbol.

186
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,110
and this is D give me a Diamond symbol.

187
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,110
Actually, this could be
variable, hash Y might do it

188
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,740
and switch.  Let's have a hash sitting here.

189
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,600
We have other suits, so we have

190
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,220
H, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades.

191
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,370
That seems correct.

192
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,080
TS: That's all of them yes.

193
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,970
This is the slightly tedious
typing part - oh right ! Spades

194
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,600
So, this goes bye bye.

195
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,142
TS: So now you can just look up with hash rather than using a inaudible set.

196
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:37,771
CB: Yes.

197
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,880
And I actually want it
to fall over quite loudly,

198
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,200
If I have something crazy as my suit.

199
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,228
TS: How are you going to make it fall over ?

200
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,914
With 'fetch'. It means that if I put

201
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,510
5 A in there that fetch is going to complain.

202
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,450
because there is no suits with key A

203
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,450
and therefore it wI'll throw an exception

204
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,970
I should probably be handling this
in a different way if I'm doing that.

205
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,370
I definitely don't want to have a default value

206
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,910
because there's no such thing.

207
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,420
I should be thinking about things like,

208
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:15,657
do I want capital H in
there and little things like that.

209
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,420
But for now I'm doing
it with the minimum viable

210
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,910
array string parser.

211
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,400
And see where that takes me.

212
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,510
TS: So your motivation here sounds like

213
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,250
you don't want it to 'silently' fail ?

214
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,680
But you want it to complain.
CB: Yes, that's fine

215
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,050
In the same way here,
for example, it takes the first symbol.

216
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,570
So if someone puts H5 for example,

217
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,457
That would also fail quite loudly.

218
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,371
If someone puts HH however,
it's not going to fail loudly.

219
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,650
But, I'm not entirely inaud,

220
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,420
and I don't want to spend time on it now

221
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,940
I'll clean it up a bit later,

222
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,480
what I would usually do

223
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,314
If I'm writing things I want to ship

224
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,142
I would put fail loudly and with better

225
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,114
errors with unexpected

226
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,370
inputs, much in the same way

227
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,485
I would probably be having to
do a fail nicely when not 5.

228
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,770
There's other things, if you
have two 5 of Hearts, you have cheat.

229
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,850
and things like that,
but let's not even go there !

230
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,600
Let's assume that that
our players are trying to be

231
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,420
honest, at least.

232
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,620
TS: we'll, I don't know enough about the

233
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,140
variance of Poker to
say whether that's I'llegal.

234
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,485
CB: I think if you have one deck
and you have 2 x 5 of Hearts

235
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,970
you can reasonably assume that
somebody's messing with the game.

236
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,057
So that's going to fail quite nicely

237
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:57,971
because I'm obviously missing quite

238
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,820
a lot of objects and things like that

239
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,400
but let's see where it's failing.

240
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,540
So, undefined method

241
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,310
Oh yes of course,
I did something here ...

242
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:12,170
Here I'm assuming
that make card is available

243
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,540
on my string, which it isn't.

244
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,650
TS: You want to make it available,
I thought you were going to do

245
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,940
some monkey patching and ....

246
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,250
we'll, if you want to do it for
fun, to do crazy things. (laughter)

247
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,910
and then see how I fail later, then sure, but

248
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,400
I love myself too much
to do that to myself.

249
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,710
inaud, so now it's complaining
that we don't have whatever that is.

250
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,170
we should re-create a 'whatever that is'

251
00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:00,110
To be honest I don't see it doing anything really smart

252
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,850
so it's just going to have,
it's called 'Pips' in English

253
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,020
that's the number on the
face of the card, is it not ?

254
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,080
TS: I think I've heard the word
'rank' but 'Pips' also seems sensible

255
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm going to stick with 'Pips'

256
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,280
Since I'm also doing hand ranker,
rank is going to confuse things.

257
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,510
TS: Oh .. that's a good point.

258
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,080
Separate words for separate ideas.

259
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,770
I believe that's helpful. (laughter)

260
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,370
OK, so I have some kind of
sI'lly strap that doesn't do much here.

261
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,828
I just want to acquire it -
rather than leave it sitting around here.

262
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,970
And let's go back to our spec. Go.

263
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,570
Excellent, we stI'll have nothing and that is simply inaud

264
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,620
because I stI'll haven't implemented it. So if we do now hand inaud cards

265
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,942
we're just going to initialise the cards.

266
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,114
I can get rid of that 

267
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:12,657
and make that cards available. 

268
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,740
this should hopefully stop complaining

269
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,057
because it did a zero failure,
so that is the one I want.

270
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,910
Let's have a look.

271
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,510
I'm creating my hand ...

272
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,820
My favourite way is also inaudible

273
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,740
and then I spent 2 minutes thinking

274
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,740
inaud spelling.
TS: Yes. 

275
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
Yes, good, certainly more convincing isn't it?

276
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,450
TS: Yes, very good.

277
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,650
I now have some 'thing' and it has the inaud of things.

278
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,740
I don't actually know that
it does pars the cards correctly.

279
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,480
And if the array looks like
I want it to look, so what I can do is

280
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,710
because, currently my parser doesn't care

281
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,850
how many cards I'm parsing in

282
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,450
I can do a very quick check.

283
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,800
so it returns the right cards.

284
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,910
as a test, and if my
array of cards is just the one

285
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,310
let's say 6 of Diamonds.

286
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,540
then I go inaud exact same.

287
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,450
And what I want is ...

288
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,200
I take my hand,
I take the cards in there,

289
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,850
I take the first one and I
want to check the suit is Diamonds

290
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,820
I also want to check that my Pips are equal to six.

291
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,800
TS: Ok.

292
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,020
And I reckon that were going
to have a surprising 'thing' because

293
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,570
I haven't cast it to an integer.

294
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,480
Since we're going to compare
them, it's a lot easier to look at

295
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,650
if they're integers.

296
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,050
That's strings - expected an
integer and got a string !

297
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:23,714
What I'm going to do is not really good practice,

298
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,050
but that should please it for now.

299
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,800
So now I can have a 'thing'
and when I put several things in there

300
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,140
it puts them in a hand
with cards, and then I can

301
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,450
check that if I do put
a card it seems relatively ok.

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,310
TS: Ok.

303
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,200
CB: If I wanted to be really
exhaustive I would go through

304
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,280
check Spades, check Hearts, check Clubs.

305
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,510
Just to see that that matching is ok.

306
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,940
And that would give
me a bit more certainty

307
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,450
about what on Earth I am doing !

308
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,050
TS: Ok

309
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,110
But that kind of does the
thing, that is good enough.

310
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,140
Now I'm going to start focusing on ....

311
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,171
If I have those two hand objects

312
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,850
and I can look at cards on them.

313
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,370
I have a nice interface with my
cards, it gives me Pips and Suits

314
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,200
How do I compare them.

315
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,540
Step away from the
computer for a second.

316
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,400
TS: Yes, it felt like this
was an administrative thing

317
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,310
Your warmed up now,
you can make two hands of cards.

318
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,057
And now it's back to compare them ?

319
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,140
CB: Yes, that's about it.

320
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,420
The first thing we can do is have some way

321
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,000
of having a hand, and
it tells me 'you have a Flush'

322
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,140
or 'you have a Pair' and
that is actually your best thing.

323
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,620
Not just 'you stI'll happen to have a Pair'

324
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,620
because the last thing I want to do is,

325
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,910
I have a card that has for example,

326
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,420
3 of a kind which is better than 2 of a kind

327
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,080
inaud which isn't very nice (laughter)

328
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,910
TS: I am roughly familiar with the rules of Poker.

329
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,880
I'm just being unnecessarily
verbose - you can just stop me.

330
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,110
No, no, talk me through it.

331
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:14,280
so if I have 3 of a kind, the last thing I want to do is

332
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,600
my hand inaud
so if I have 3 of a kind, the last thing I want to do is

333
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,140
my hand inaud

334
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,850
Oh ! we have two of a kind, excellent.

335
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,910
whereas the best thing I
could do with this is 3 of a kind.

336
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,250
ST: So for any individual hand
there might be several possible

337
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,540
classification of the cards in it, but we want

338
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,370
to use the one that is most likely to

339
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,200
cause this hand to beat another one.

340
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,450
CB: Yes, you want the
highest possible rank of things

341
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,540
you can get in Poker,

342
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,570
so if I have 4 fours then I can't inaud

343
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,820
I want 4 of a kind,
not 3 of a kind, and definitely not a Pair.

344
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,714
TS: Not a high card.

345
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,657
CB: Definitely not.

346
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,280
It sounds like your first line
of interest, is classifying these hands

347
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
according to what kind they are.

348
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,450
TS: How were you expecting to approach that ?

349
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,220
Essentially I want to look at a
hand and it gives me what the rank is.

350
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,340
so it tells me if it's a straight or thing

351
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,420
So it feels to me like we're going
to have some kind of rank method

352
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,220
on the hand that is going to return

353
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,140
and 'this is the thing that you can do with it'.

354
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,057
That is the best possible one, 

355
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,828
which we can half implement for now.

356
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,540
The first thing I'm going to
do is create a spec for my hand

357
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,050
because we're going to start adding stuff to that.

358
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:35,171
Quick housekeeping.
TS: Yes.

359
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,570
And I'm going to be describing my hand

360
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,710
And, I want some kind of method inaud

361
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,540
I'll call it 'Rank'

362
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:54,400
I have no particular reason to know whether

363
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,880
that's a good idea or not now.

364
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,020
So I'll keep it as it is.

365
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,428
And it returns the best type of hand,

366
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:14,742
from it's own cards.

367
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,050
ST: Ok. (laughter)

368
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,510
Which seems easy.

369
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,820
And I might regret this
because maybe it's not

370
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,370
the easiest choice I could have made.

371
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,020
I'm not going to put in a context for now

372
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,510
I'm not sure where I'm going.

373
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,910
So, I have a hand and .......

374
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,200
So this is where things get a bit annoying.

375
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,420
I have some kind of hand around.

376
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,850
For now I'm going to use the hand parser

377
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,970
which makes me feel this is
not the right interface for the problem,

378
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,140
If I have to use it in such a way, but if I have

379
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,370
say, 5 of Hearts, 5 of Diamonds,

380
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,000
we're actually going to take a Pair.

381
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,050
and see where it takes us.

382
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,310
7 of Diamonds,

383
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,220
8 of Diamonds.

384
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,570
This should just say is 'we have a Pair'
and by the way that Pair is a Pair of 5s.

385
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,680
For now let's start with 'you have a Pair'

386
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,171
TS: As you said, that
might be enough information.

387
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:03,314
If there's another hand
that doesn't have a Pair in it,

388
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,971
you've already determined that.

389
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,620
The first thing you want to
know is do I have a better hand?

390
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,510
and then if your two hands are not the same rank,

391
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,250
then you try calculating it.

392
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,310
my initial reckoning is that
it wI'll be easier to calculate

393
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,400
what the highest card is at the
time I'm also establishing the rank.

394
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,370
So for now I want my interface
to just return the type of hand.

395
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,740
But in the future, I also want it to say,

396
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,570
this is the type of hand and
this is the highest card that counts.

397
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,770
Just in case there's a tie.

398
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,540
TS: Alright.

399
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,510
CB: Let's assume that's my
hand and I want hand.rank.

400
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,110
So 'expect' hand.rank.

401
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,310
to equal, and then ...

402
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,370
It turns information about
the winning potential of the hand.

403
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,940
This is a terrible description !

404
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,220
I'm just going to let it go, because in a minute,

405
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,280
I wI'll probably change my mind
about what this should look like.

406
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,170
So expect the hand equals that .......not that

407
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,800
This is failing quite nicely because I haven't done

408
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,710
all my inquiring correctly.

409
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,080
I'm doing sI'lly thing with
sI'lly shortcuts here.
(laughter)

410
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,480
I also don't have my hand parser.

411
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,314
What I don't like about that

412
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,370
is that now I can call this extra
class and I have this extra thing

413
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,850
that has all this logic here.

414
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,650
So rethinking it now I would
probably move that logic around

415
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,510
And have my hand.new handles inaudible things like that.

416
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,480
and my hand.new can take a hand parser

417
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,600
as one of it's attributes
of the method and go and

418
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,480
I can make sure that the
logic of if it's H it's Hearts,

419
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,620
and if it's D it's Diamonds,
just goes somewhere else.

420
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,680
I'm not happy about that interface.

421
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,080
Because I don't like
stopping in the middle of a 'thing'

422
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,370
to do .........

423
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,200
This is not a nice interface,
not what I wanted to do.

424
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,457
TS: So your queuing up a
bit of re-factoring to do ?

425
00:28:56,714 --> 00:29:00,457
CB: Yes, my tests have passed so
I can't afford to just go off on a tangent

426
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,080
and go to fix all the things.

427
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,800
So let's just have a quick go.

428
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,620
So that's parsing, and that's failing.

429
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:23,114
inaud returns nil

430
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:25,171
which is pretty much what you'd expect

431
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,428
because it returns nil.

432
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,420
OK, so I've got all my cards

433
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,880
and how do I want to detect a Pair.

434
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,570
For their cards if I want to detect a Pair,

435
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,480
all I care about is the Pips on the cards.

436
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,420
I have all the cards, I can look
at how many Pips there are

437
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,710
for each of those cards and I can
count for each possible Pip value,

438
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,220
how many of that Pip I have.
TS: Ok.

439
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,940
So if I have say, 5678 here

440
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,510
There was 2 x 5s, 1 x 6, 1 x7 and 1 x 8

441
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,420
TS: I see so your counting then
barring how many Pips they have.

442
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,540
you want to somehow say I've got 2x5s, I've got 1x6 etc.

443
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,280
CB: Yes, I want some kind of Pip counter

444
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,650
that sort of mashes them up in
some structure they can read nicely.

445
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,280
Ideally, if I had a thing like that then I would have

446
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,510
something along the lines of .....

447
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,650
I'm going to do that as a hash

448
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,710
but I would expect my
result to look a bit like this.

449
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,600
I would like a magical
thing that does that for me.

450
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,280
And once I have that then I can check if I have

451
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,050
any things that so happen to have 2 of the 'thing'.

452
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,770
And if I do then it's a Pair.

453
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,170
Otherwise, it's a highest card.
So that's about it.

454
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,114
I want to implement a thing that does that.

455
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,450
So what does this do ? I would say it's a 'Pip counter'

456
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,000
but it's not a great word for it.

457
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,600
I'm going to call it Pip counter and ............

458
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,140
This is a sI'lly thing I do,
and I may as we'll do it.

459
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,850
on camera, (the world wI'll laugh), so when

460
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,457
I have a terrible name for a thing,
I just put a hash hash bob

461
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,342
I was given the clean code
thing when I started programming.

462
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,171
And it has this amazing thing about how

463
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,914
inaud not name your methods.

464
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,280
Things like holy hand grenade for destroy,

465
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,710
and sI'lly things like that, so I always put a bob

466
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,800
when I have bad name thing, and I usually

467
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,285
have fun, inaud my interface.

468
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,000
when I'm finishing off an object.

469
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,250
So let's say it's a Pip counter thing, for now.

470
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:06,820
TS: Ok.

471
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,970
So what does my Pip count do,

472
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,220
Hey, we've run a test !

473
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,770
That is going to do that for me.

474
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,680
So if I have a Pip count ....

475
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,370
now whether that should be
in the public interface is debatable.

476
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,650
ST: Right.

477
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,370
CB: But I'm just going to keep it there for now.

478
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,680
As I don't yet know where we're going.

479
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,710
So if I have a pip count and I am ...

480
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,370
parsing exactly that hand then
this is exactly the thing I want.

481
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,710
I'm going to stop returning that.

482
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,820
There we go...

483
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,571
That should fail quite loudly, let's this test.

484
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,080
There we go ....

485
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,450
Yes, we've got nil, excellent.

486
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,457
So how are we going
implement this.  I have my cards

487
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,510
And for each of those cards I have Pips.

488
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
I can just inaud

489
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,280
Suddenly here I have an array of numbers,

490
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,170
For a thing like this I need my documentation,

491
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,170
in case I don't remember everything

492
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,680
There is a Ruby collect on Ruby array

493
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,510
This is dash.  It's a
documentation tool that I like to use.

494
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,370
TS: So you have all of the Ruby inaud.

495
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,140
CB: This is just a quick reminder for me because

496
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,450
I reckon this has already been solved

497
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,250
But maybe not, who knows.

498
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,970
Essentially I want to loop over my array

499
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,600
and count the number of
incidences of each 'thing'.

500
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,820
Which actually I could
do in any number of ways.

501
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,370
I can't remember off the top of my head

502
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,340
how I would do that in pure Ruby.
Any suggestions welcome !

503
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,680
TS: I don't know that there is a method in the

504
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,770
array that does that.

505
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,600
the only thing that comes to mind is

506
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,970
a 'group by' method,
which won't do what you want

507
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,880
but wI'll do a related thing, which is

508
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,620
group together all of them

509
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,740
All of the 5s, all of the 6s and all of the 7s,

510
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,850
but that doesn't give you what you want.

511
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,170
CB: Does that give me
an array of arrays then ?

512
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,940
TS: It gives you a hash,
where the keys of the hash are

513
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,370
So the key in the hash would be

514
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,400
5 and the elements in the array would be

515
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,940
all of the 5 pip cards there.

516
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,680
and then it would be six and the array inaud.

517
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,800
CB: Ok, I could map on that quite easily.

518
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,280
let's do a 'group by' and see how that works.

519
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,800
So group by ....

520
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,171
inaud an array.

521
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,828
TS: It wI'll be in the new model I expect.

522
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,028
CB: Let's just search,

523
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,450
no it's not letting me search.

524
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,650
I'm in the wrong scope for it.

525
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,940
Numerable group by .... no, no no.

526
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
It's just giving me answerable stuff.

527
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
TS: Maybe that was a bad idea.

528
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,885
CB: All of the documentation.

529
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,770
TS: If you can implement it yourself.

530
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,200
CB: I shall implement it
in the space of a minute.

531
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,200
That should be fine, Iv'e got all my Pips.

532
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,570
What I'm wondering is, do I want

533
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,880
just 52617181 or do I want

534
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,000
all of the keys of all the possible things.

535
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,420
and then how many cards I have,

536
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,020
but I don't think it
makes a lot of difference.

537
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,800
TS: It depends what you want.

538
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,480
CB: Group by, I was very excited by this.

539
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,650
Ok, yes fair enough.

540
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,280
TS: That's not quite what
you said, but it's close.

541
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,020
in that you would get the right keys

542
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,420
but your values
instead of being how many

543
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,140
cards there were it would
be an array of those cards.

544
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,450
CB: I'm just wondering inaud which is

545
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,680
this is not particularly pretty

546
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,540
It probably has a better way of doing it.

547
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,650
it might be the default for that.

548
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,800
Let's run a test and
see what that returns.

549
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,650
Yes, that gives me arrays.

550
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,620
Now we can just have a 'thing'.

551
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,342
This is my grouped cards, and then I can

552
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,710
say - group cards and
then for each of my things,

553
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,480
I can say ....

554
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:25,650
TS: Ah, ok,

555
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,000
so each of those arrays
you are turning into a number.

556
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,340
by counting it.

557
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,510
CB: Yes so let's see how that works.

558
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,220
It's not very elegant but it should meet the test.

559
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,770
and pass, so that's close enough.

560
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,771
We stI'll have a failure
because we're not ranking stuff.

561
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,342
So, we are in the magical
world where only

562
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,310
2 rankings exist.

563
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,480
There is Pair and high card.

564
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,650
If these are all my grouped cards,

565
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,540
and if I have 'anywhere',

566
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,080
in the number of group cards I have

567
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:13,910
a 2, then it's a win,

568
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,400
and otherwise it's not.

569
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,540
This is my minimal viable code,
it's something along the lines of

570
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,340
so this should return.

571
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,770
I have a rank of type Pair, otherwise

572
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,280
I have a rank of highest.

573
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,250
I'm not quite sure about line 10 now.

574
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,480
So I have all the values, I need to find ....

575
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,280
I think this is where the web tests help me.
TS: Yes (laughter)

576
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,000
I want to inaud group of cards.

577
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,371
I've done something sI'lly.
Of course, this is called Pip count

578
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,400
Let;s try that again.

579
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,540
So it does something, and
for the sake of completeness

580
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,940
I also want to start using better names now.

581
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,170
And here I have a hand with just a Pair.

582
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,450
and here I wI'll have
a hand with nothing in it,

583
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,200
which I wI'll call highest, as a type.

584
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,220
So if I have a highest hand, I essentially want

585
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,000
it to be pretty much this,

586
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,880
but I'm just going to put something there,

587
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,910
which as you see actually is a straight.

588
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:57,485
So, this shouldn't be ranking as highest.

589
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,650
TS: Does that matter ?

590
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,510
CB: No I'm quite happy about that.

591
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,710
It's fine, it's just setting
the scope of the problem to

592
00:40:08,028 --> 00:40:09,685
solving a very small type 'thing'.

593
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,570
TS: Like you said before,
your I'maging a smaller version

594
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,314
of Poker that only has 5 cards right ?

595
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,450
CB: Yes, a simpler and more boring world.

596
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,914
And now we have no failures.

597
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,680
I have a way of getting
arrays and then suddenly

598
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,742
I have one Pair, and another with nothing

599
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
and it does rankings.
TS: Great !

600
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,310
So now we have some kind of way,

601
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,570
in an oversimplified game of Poker

602
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,910
to say I have a Pair and I have a highest.

603
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,480
So what I would really like to do

604
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,340
is start Implementing a few more things.

605
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,450
So I think the super easy way to go is

606
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,170
we're not going to do just Pairs

607
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,570
but we're going to find 3 or a kind, and 4 of a kind.

608
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,600
and make sure the right thing comes out,

609
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,480
and by that I mean,

610
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,080
if I create a 3 of a kind, let's call it a '3 hand'.

611
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,420
So if we have a 3 of a kind hand, it's going to be

612
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,742
I need 5 of Hearts Diamonds and Spades.

613
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,310
and that at the moment it's
going to return a Pair, I presume.

614
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,080
but actually we want to return 3 of a kind,

615
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,450
so this, if I have the rank, should be type 3.

616
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,770
so if I start running this file now....

617
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,050
Not like this,

618
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,540
and not like this either.

619
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,200
I think I'm doing something wrong .... there we go.

620
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,480
I do have a failure because it is assuming

621
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,200
that I have type highest and not type 3.

622
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,420
because I am matching for exactly 2,

623
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,620
and obviously it's 3.

624
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,970
This might make my life a bit easier

625
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,280
because I don't need to make sure

626
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,370
that I'm doing things in the right order,

627
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,170
for that specific comparison.

628
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,371
I reckon it does matter for other things but,

629
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,820
let's get to that when we get to that.

630
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,480
I'm staring to write
some pretty terrible code now.

631
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:35,885
so if I have 3 then it becomes

632
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,740
3 of a kind and if I have 4 then

633
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,740
suddenly it becomes 4 of of a kind.

634
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,620
but that is pretty bad.

635
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,510
I'm just going to check that
my tests do pass nicely.

636
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,540
And as they don't .... it is 3 of a kind.

637
00:43:06,942 --> 00:43:10,220
This is 3, so this should now parser inaud.

638
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,000
This now knows what a 3 of a kind is.

639
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,400
I could write a quick 4 of a kind ones that we have

640
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,914
that we haven't covered for the future

641
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,770
when we're going to
be adding more things.

642
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,370
I want to make sure
that I'm not breaking things

643
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,880
let's just create some
test data with a 4 of a kind hand.

644
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,740
This is terribly verbose, but we should
have here 5 of Clubs and that should pass.

645
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,620
This is working out fine,

646
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,080
This however, looks pretty terrible.

647
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,970
So there must be a smarter way of doing this.

648
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,340
I could jump in right there
and try to do some kind of ....

649
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,710
look at the Pip count and the values

650
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,370
and then if it's 2 it's a Pair, 3 of a kind, 4 four of a kind.

651
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,510
What I'm thinking now is that it matters
things along the lines of for example

652
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,080
I'm going to take a problematic example of the full house, where

653
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,080
at the moment my code
would give me back a 3 of a kind.

654
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,080
I definitely don't want it to say that.

655
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,480
I want it to be a full house.

656
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,770
What I want to avoid now is making an abstraction

657
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,280
on this logic of pit counts, when actually,

658
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,000
it's not clear to me as to where that should live.

659
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,770
What I would like to try doing now

660
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,280
is try Implementing full house
which has 3 of a kind, two of a kind

661
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,170
in the same hand.

662
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,450
Get that working and then at that point

663
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,600
hopefully, I wI'll know

664
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,140
how I want to look at those card counts.

665
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,510
TS: Ok.

666
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,970
So I can extract that.

667
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,680
I'm going to leave this
horror in a tiny bit longer

668
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,220
until I know with more
certainty where I'm heading.

669
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,940
TS: So even though your unhappy with your code

670
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,110
your going to hold of from re-factoring it

671
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,940
because you're not
confident that your solution to it

672
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,370
is complete yet.

673
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,020
You don't want to introduce
an abstraction that won't fit.

674
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,510
Your worried that if you extract it at this point,

675
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,250
then you wI'll end up with something

676
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,680
that won't support full house.

677
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,770
Is that what you mean ?
CB: Yes, absolutely.

678
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,710
My initial premature abstraction is

679
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,910
I just map the number of pip count values to a type.

680
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,480
and I can sense that that's
going to fail when I get to full house.

681
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:44,110
I want to see how I wI'll implement full house
which is going to create more inaud in this code,

682
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,910
but I think it would help
me finding the right structure.

683
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,140
if there is such a thing as inaud structure,

684
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,970
I find myself guilty of it a lot of times.
TS: Ok.

685
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,000
CB: I'm going to do a quick
test for my full house hand.

686
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,770
and it has 5 of Hearts, 5 of Diamonds,
5 of Spades, 6 of Clubs and 6 of Hearts.

687
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,650
So we have inaud 6s, and here we go.

688
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,540
This is going to fail nicely.

689
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,280
because we haven't inaud that yet and it's detecting a Pair.

690
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,880
which is not what we want.

691
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,880
Right now with my code I'm saying

692
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,170
if there's 2 let's go there, if there'
three let's go there, if there's four let's go there.

693
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,110
This feels counter intuitive because in Poker,

694
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:51,620
what I want to check is do I have an array or flush, or a straight flush etc.

695
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,770
There is an order in which you would check

696
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:57,540
because you would start
(in your head) with the highest hand

697
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,940
and if you don't have the best possible thing,

698
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,740
you would lower the expectations of your hand

699
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,940
and try to get as far down as you can.

700
00:47:07,342 --> 00:47:11,200
The way I have written this code
as a human trying to solve the problem

701
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,820
I can also see it as part of a full house.

702
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,680
so if we do a bit of reshuffling,

703
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,650
and by that I mean check things,

704
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:26,140
(this is terrible code by the way),
but check things in a way

705
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,820
so I start with the nicest possible outcome.

706
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,020
and as I go along I get less
desirable outcomes from my hand.

707
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,200
then that would have given
me 3 of a kind, as a full house

708
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,280
which is less wrong but stI'll pretty wrong !

709
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,710
TS: But what  you've there,
it seems to me is you were expecting it

710
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,600
then your saying there is this implied thing.

711
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,820
but if you're explaining what a 3 of a kind is

712
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,740
there's this implication, we'll it's not 4 of a kind

713
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,850
a Pair is not 3 of a kind,
nor 4 of a kind, and so it seems

714
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,280
now your code more accurately reflects that.

715
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:13,170
whereas before it was just working what 'by accident' ?

716
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,420
CB: It was working only in the case where a specific hand

717
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,000
only has for example, only
3 of a kind and nothing else.

718
00:48:23,257 --> 00:48:26,228
TS: I see, it's the full house
that's going to bring this out.

719
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,650
CB: The full house is bringing this out

720
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,114
and I think that other hands
are going to bring this out anyway

721
00:48:32,114 --> 00:48:35,771
because if you have a flush that
also happens to have a Pair in there

722
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:39,200
you want to check flush first,
it doesn't matter if you have a Pair.

723
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,020
In the case of a full house,
tell my code go along the lines of

724
00:48:46,942 --> 00:48:49,142
if I happen to have 3 in my pip count values

725
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,485
then two things can happen.

726
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,420
Either I have also in my pip count a value that is

727
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,971
2, so I have a 3 and a 2 and therefore a full house.

728
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,514
Otherwise, the best thing I do have

729
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:03,600
is 3 of a kind.

730
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,510
So that would make my test pass,
but it's beginning to look terrible

731
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,280
First let's check that I didn't get this one wrong.

732
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,400
so now that parses nicely and this looks awful !

733
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,200
I believe there's a problem in how I'm testing those

734
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,080
TS: What's the problem ?

735
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,740
CB: I'm checking that an
array includes a certain number.

736
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,450
and what I want to know is does my array,

737
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,250
in the case of 4 of a kind it includes 4, for sure.

738
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,570
and I don't need to look at the rest,

739
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:51,110
but in the others there is a number
of things that we want to look at.

740
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,480
What I want to try doing is...........

741
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,400
TS: It sounds like you're
switching into re-factoring.

742
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:06,740
CB: Yes.

743
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,110
TS: Why have you chosen this point.

744
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,250
because you said there are some
other hands that you haven't implemented yet

745
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,910
Do you feel that you have come to a point now

746
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,970
where you have sufficient confidence

747
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,714
in your implementation so far to start factoring it ?

748
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:25,228
CB: I think I have sufficient
confidence to start thinking about it.

749
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:28,257
But I might hit a mental
block in a few seconds (laughter).

750
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,370
I want to see how the
other hands are going to work out.

751
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,370
So all my other hands are along the lines of

752
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,280
straight and flush, and we can
assume that's already out of the way.

753
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,200
By the time the code wI'll hit those

754
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,310
and now we're counting the
cards we've already excluded.

755
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,620
a couple of those things.

756
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,850
I stI'll don't like this.

757
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,940
I don't like entering this type of code because

758
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,000
if 4 of a kind is better than a flush, for example,

759
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,880
so I want to look at those things later.

760
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,510
I am starting to imagine that I am creating

761
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,450
as I go along - this is a list of all the things

762
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,710
you can do in Poker,

763
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,370
and this is how we'll they rank in the world of poker.

764
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,620
the highest and the lowest ranking - 1.

765
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,050
And a straight flush is as high as it gets.

766
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,910
What I am creating in my head is some kind of 'thing.

767
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,910
along the lines of a thing called Poker ranks

768
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,570
which is something along the lines of.

769
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,020
The most desirable 'thing' is a straight flush.

770
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,540
we'll.... I don't know, I don't know how many

771
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,480
different types of cards there are
in Poker. Let's say 10

772
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,800
but I think that's wrong, and then we have 4 of a kind

773
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,000
and that would be a rating line, and then

774
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,880
so on and so forth.

775
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,310
Each of those can have a method

776
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,028
That checks the card is what it is.

777
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,770
But that would re-use quite a lot of code

778
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,570
and I'm not happy about that either.

779
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,820
So, let's not do that.

780
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,220
Ok, so you're talking about having some sort

781
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,480
of scoring system.

782
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,940
TS: What was your motivation
for wanting to score them ?

783
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,770
CB: I'm motivated to have some defined order which

784
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,342
looks for the best and worst possible outcomes

785
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,600
other than it checks for them
in a different order in the code.

786
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,020
TS: So you want to make that more explicit

787
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,400
rather than writing a method that looks like

788
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,480
you could do it in any order.
CB: Yes.

789
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,820
I'm going to stard doing inaud method.

790
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:20,400
Just so I can see where things are going

791
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,020
This is all going to be private.

792
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,940
I'm going to quickly go through those

793
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:33,514
That was a bit odd ......

794
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,200
Now we are assuming
that we have those magical

795
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,000
methods. It has 4, has 2 has 3

796
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,970
And checks whether there is a Pair

797
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,770
or a 3 or a combination of 4 in there.

798
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,540
which doesn't mean it's a three of a kind.

799
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:56,085
it means there happens to be
3 cards of the same kind in there.

800
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,000
So if we have 'has 4', then this is

801
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,857
stI'll include 4 and in much the same way

802
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,000
inaud has 3 and has 2

803
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,710
and that's going to be
pretty much what the pick is.

804
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,570
and that's a bit verbose

805
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,280
but I'm not so bothered about that

806
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,710
because it's inad private methods and I can get round to it later

807
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,310
if I feel it is necessary.

808
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,200
This feels more readable to me.

809
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,371
It feels like a 4 kind type

810
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,971
It has the Haskell check.

811
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,740
And for the full house, this needs
to be true and this needs to be true.

812
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,080
3 of a kind check this only needs to be true

813
00:54:35,457 --> 00:54:36,971
Pair has Pair needs to be true.

814
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,220
So suddenly I have all my cards,

815
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,800
all of the types of things I can do in Poker.

816
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,940
and I have a combination of methods

817
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,340
that can tell me exactly why that would be.

818
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:50,280
TS: Right,

819
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,250
CB: So the easy way of doing it would be:

820
00:54:56,028 --> 00:54:56,914
If has 4 then that.

821
00:54:56,914 --> 00:54:58,085
This is stI'll verbose.

822
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,800
I start re-factoring and then usually I think

823
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,142
add a lot of stuff, make it very explicit

824
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:04,771
then start compressing later.

825
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,057
So elsif full house

826
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,200
then type full house

827
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,257
elsif has 3 then....

828
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,971
3 of a kind, elsif has Pair, then Pair

829
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,257
I'm going to have to implement full house quickly,

830
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,057
missing def here.

831
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,850
Here we go, it has 3 and ....

832
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,714
maybe not multiply these.

833
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,970
I don't know what that does actually.

834
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,570
inaud methods

835
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,600
It complains loudly but I don't know how.

836
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,371
This feels more readable.

837
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:52,570
That's kind of what I would like inaud

838
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:53,800
It doesn't.

839
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,880
That's because question marks are nice

840
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:07,020
it's maybe not the day to invent new methods in inaud

841
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:13,970
inaud has Pair simply because I called it has 2 and has Pair

842
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,085
it has 2 and it has 4 so

843
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,257
let's keep it that way.

844
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,280
Go.

845
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,570
and now were back in action.

846
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,250
this is more readable.

847
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,680
We're checking things in order.

848
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,540
there is a better way of doing that but let's wait

849
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,170
until I have a couple more hands

850
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,342
and I can drive out something a bit better.

851
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,420
inaud with the ranking but I'm quite happy with it yet.

852
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:40,685
TS: Ok.

853
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:48,514
CB: Do you have a favorite
hand that you want to go next.

854
00:56:48,514 --> 00:56:50,428
TS: we'll I don't want to prejudice you. 

855
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:51,857
What's your favorite hand ?

856
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:52,885
CB: A straight flush.

857
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:53,942
TS: Then go with that.

858
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,940
CB: So, we're going to have a straight flush.

859
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,880
TS: Seems a bit optimistic as you 
don't have straights or flushes yet

860
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,220
but if you want to yes.

861
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:05,314
I think that's going to drive out the changes quickly.
but if you want to yes.

862
00:57:05,314 --> 00:57:07,942
I think that's going to drive out the changes quickly.

863
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,485
But yes your right, may be a bit optimistic.

864
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:19,342
In much the same way that full house
has 2 or 3 situations of straight flushes in

865
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,742
there's a straight and there's flush

866
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,714
TS: Is straight or flush easier to do?

867
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,000
I reckon flush.

868
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,170
TS: Why don't we do flush then.

869
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:30,740
CB: Alright.

870
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,600
Let's quickly create a flush hand.

871
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,280
The test definition is right at the top.
This file is getting verbose.

872
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,280
TS: It's a good job you've got that hand parser

873
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,340
otherwise it would be inaud

874
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,971
CB: I don't want to imagine what it would look like

875
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,542
if we had to do doubles for this.

876
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,050
So flush, let's go for all Hearts.

877
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,570
I'm going to give myself a very disappointing hand.

878
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,257
If you had that hand in Poker, you would say WHY !!!

879
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,400
So that should give me a flush

880
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,370
and I'm going to check that it's definitely failing.

881
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,400
TS: What does it think it is

882
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,940
CB: That's an interesting one.

883
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,800
We have a new problem now.

884
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:34,800
TS: What's going on?

885
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,400
CB: we'll, 10, it's got two numbers.

886
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,310
so it's not parsing it properly.

887
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,570
I'm taking the first character only

888
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,220
and in the second I'm taking the second character.

889
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,620
There's two ways we can solve this

890
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,485
I represent 10 in another way, like zero or something.

891
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,680
inaud that very quickly change the parser

892
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:00,657
so that it doesn't take the zero, and the one

893
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,940
and it takes something a bit smarter.

894
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,770
TS: The error that's coming out there

895
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,085
is that because you did the fetch on the hash ?

896
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:09,280
CB: Yes, if I hadn't done a fetch on a hash.

897
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,800
and I had put a default value.

898
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,971
who knows what would happen in that

899
00:59:12,971 --> 00:59:16,450
inaud fail loudly.

900
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,910
TS: Yes, it's already coming on.

901
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,910
CB: It is failing loudly, so ok ....

902
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,400
here we're taking only the first character,

903
00:59:25,571 --> 00:59:27,371
and here only the last character.

904
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,620
What I want to do is

905
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,000
take the last one

906
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,400
inaud I can do something along the lines of

907
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,970
Oh, I don't even know.

908
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:48,110
Now how I would do that,
and I know that's incorrect

909
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,450
would be something along those lines.

910
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,080
There must be a better way though.

911
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,340
I know there's a way of doing it with minus ones

912
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,140
but I don't want to do that right now.

913
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,140
I'm feeling particularly lazy.

914
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,570
Here, I want to go up to cards.

915
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,570
inaud minus one, take that as a string.

916
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,770
I want to run the spec quickly because

917
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,680
I reckon I've got this wrong.

918
01:00:24,571 --> 01:00:27,420
inaud arguments, what have we done now,

919
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,200
This is stI'll a string.

920
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,771
I wI'll make sure I've got a
test that does the 10 again

921
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,540
might as we'll

922
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,050
let's just run this file now.

923
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,457
Now we have a hand parser 20 length, so that's not.

924
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,685
So hand parser on line 20 calling length on

925
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,340
It's an array, no.  No it's called card string

926
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,000
inaud

927
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,170
so one inaud for zero, why
does it think it has an argument.

928
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:22,000
because parenthesis

929
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,420
Ah, inaud method, this is terrible.

930
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:33,285
so last number of ....

931
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:38,940
This is terrible, I should just do it in minus ones.

932
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,970
TS: How does the minus one thing work ?

933
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:45,828
I believe it puts you in an
imaginary space between

934
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:49,650
the start and end of your
row, but I might be wrong.

935
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,970
So what I wI'll do is....

936
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,110
it's the end of the card number index.

937
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,400
this should be something along those lines.

938
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,680
and here I want to go up to the inaud card index

939
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,257
and here I want to go front
zero to the end card index minus

940
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,250
No, I want to go to the end
of card index and here I want to go

941
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:27,450
to this.  So this should stI'll fail,
if I reckon I've got something else.

942
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:32,420
TS: That's not very optimistic.

943
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,680
CB: We have key not found

944
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,280
that's just failing again.

945
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,310
so my card string of this is not working out.

946
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,110
So this is nil because

947
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,000
end of card number plus one is

948
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,080
not quite what I want it to be.

949
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,820
Why is old code popping up ?

950
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:08,140
It has been returning inaud laughter.

951
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,970
Let's get back to our tests

952
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,620
It's lucky that I spotted that when I did.

953
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:23,400
this is the failure which led us
to another failure, but this is good.

954
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,250
Now, where is our flush ?

955
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,680
this is where I don't know Poker
quite as we'll as I would like to

956
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,400
so elsif flush, type flush.

957
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,850
Where does flush belong on this sort of thing

958
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,400
It is above full house. Yes.

959
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,220
TS: It doesn't actually matter.

960
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,050
No, that's right but it would matter

961
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,600
to someone who plays Poker perhaps.

962
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,280
TS: At the moment you don't have any code

963
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,110
that compares your hand
to find out which one is better.

964
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,770
as long as they are correctly classified that's ok.

965
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,400
CB: Yes, so let's implement inaud very quick flush.

966
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:19,420
so what my flush is ....

967
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,940
in much the same way as I'm
asking do I have two of the same thing.

968
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,880
I'm saying can you look at all my suits

969
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,370
and tell me if they're all the same.

970
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,370
and that's about it.

971
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,570
Much in the same way
I'm doing the pip count,

972
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,650
I probably want something
along the lines of a suit count.

973
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,020
that does this but with suits.

974
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:51,020
and here I'm going to do the dupe flag which is inaud. this

975
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:55,250
inaud a better abstraction to use here.

976
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,770
so here I'm grouping my suits.

977
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:03,620
I'm going to write a quick test to
make sure this is doing what I think it is

978
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:08,650
because I'm not confident enough
to reckon that it's all going to be fine.

979
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,710
So in this hand I have

980
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,940
my Pair hand which I am using

981
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:21,310
It has 4 Diamonds and 1 Heart.

982
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,710
so I should have Heart 1 and Diamonds 4.

983
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,740
It should'nt be the pip
count should be the suit count

984
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,480
I believe that's what I called it. Yes.

985
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,020
Now I have two failures.

986
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,620
This is the expected failure

987
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,650
inaud method suits.

988
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,250
Not the interface I was programming to

989
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,680
So this should be suit and not suits.

990
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:00,170
And now it seems to be working
and we're back on our problem.

991
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,110
which is permitting flush.

992
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,140
but now if I have some kind of flush count

993
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,850
rather than suit count then
suddenly my life is quite a lot easier.

994
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,710
I can implement this .... let's see

995
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,000
Now I have a flush.

996
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:35,970
Very quickly a straight

997
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:41,050
inaud was more interesting and more complicated

998
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,140
not something we've done so far

999
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,200
so I have 5 of Hearts, 6 of Hearts 7, of Hearts, Ace of Hearts

1000
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,450
and a 9 of Diamonds.

1001
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,340
because it's not a straight flush.

1002
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:57,050
let's check if this this is failing nicely. Yes.

1003
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,850
And let's put our straight somewhere in there.

1004
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,280
There we go.

1005
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,370
and if flush and straight in much the same way

1006
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,680
Let's have a look and see if those ones

1007
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,170
what I care about is the inaud and not the suits.

1008
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:25,800
inaud list of cards and their face values

1009
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,200
and I need to make sure they are consecutive.

1010
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:28,600
TS: Ok.

1011
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,310
CB: How wI'll I do that ?

1012
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,000
TS: Good question.

1013
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:37,200
The first thing I would
probably want to do is abstract out

1014
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,800
or if the cards are just the array of values.

1015
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:42,650
because this is what I care about.

1016
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,450
Let's see, where are our cards ?

1017
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,650
What I want is this

1018
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:54,080
Now I have a sort of array
that is 3567, something like that.

1019
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:58,340
In all likelihood it could be 47892

1020
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,800
and completely unsorted.

1021
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,080
so let's just sort that really quickly.

1022
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,600
and we have a sorted card that leaves

1023
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,570
I don't know why I'm
doing it in a destructive way.

1024
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,850
I just like inaud a bit sI'lly.

1025
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:26,970
So I have a inaud card

1026
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,600
What I want to know is are they consecutive.

1027
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:37,480
Is there something that does that for me ?

1028
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,970
inaud to re-implement it.

1029
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,170
TS: I'm not sure.

1030
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,850
CB: Ok, so what I care about

1031
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:46,570
if I'm trying to determine
if things are consecutive

1032
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,000
Let's assume we live in
a world where Aces don't exist.

1033
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:51,770
TS: Ok.

1034
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:56,080
CB: Because Aces .... no I don't want to go there

1035
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,650
So if I have 12345 as in Ace 2345, that's a straight

1036
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:07,220
but I can also inaud the high card, the King.

1037
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:11,800
inaud I could just have a bunch of numbers

1038
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,650
and all I need to care about is

1039
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:18,020
is to look at the face
value on there and on there,

1040
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,570
they are sorted, so if the difference between

1041
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,740
this Pair and this Pair
and this Pair is always one,

1042
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:25,820
then I've won and it's a straight.

1043
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:28,971
but I can't re-do that if I'm doing Ace because

1044
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,620
my Ace would potentially sit on
one side or other of the array.

1045
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:40,110
Let's assume Aces are just ones for now.

1046
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:43,770
and then I'm going to make sure that I

1047
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,540
write a test which is
'it works with a straight with high Ace'.

1048
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,510
and it works with a straight with low ace.

1049
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,080
TS: Which one of those is the special case ?

1050
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:06,000
CB: It depends how I classify an Ace.

1051
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,510
If Ace is a one in the way I write it

1052
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,400
then low Ace isn't my special case.

1053
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,650
But if I write Ace as an A for example,

1054
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,450
which then puts it in
the category of King Queen....

1055
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,170
which I would assign a higher point value.

1056
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,600
So then 10 is 10, Jack is 11, Queen is 12, King is 13.

1057
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,910
then this is both one and 14.

1058
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:30,140
TS: Ok.

1059
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,970
Which might be how I implement it.

1060
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,510
If you see an Ace in there ....

1061
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,170
look at the array and count it as a one,

1062
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,680
and then look at the other array and count it as 14.

1063
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,740
and see where it takes you.

1064
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,740
You can't really have a
straight that takes both anyway

1065
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,480
so that should sort us out nicely.

1066
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:56,540
We might be looking later
at where's my high card, on hand.

1067
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,880
then that's also going to inaud

1068
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,514
inaud 1, 14 inaud

1069
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,000
Let's assume that we are taking Aces as ....

1070
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:11,510
(do I have any examples here?) No.

1071
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,020
So I'm going to write Aces with an A

1072
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,020
because of just personal preference.

1073
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,450
No particular reason.

1074
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,820
My special case is going to be inaud sting with no Ace

1075
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:36,370
I've just realized something
that I had completely forgotten about

1076
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,080
right now if we look at the hand parser....

1077
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,400
I've chosen cards that
translate in a lovely way

1078
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,170
to integers, but if I do something like that....

1079
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,280
Let's say Queen of Diamonds.

1080
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:58,480
Let's say 10 is 10 Jack is 11, Queen is 12

1081
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,080
I actually would want this to happen.

1082
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,140
number 12, got zero, excellent.

1083
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,710
Let's go back into my hand parser

1084
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,650
this is going to be another
one of those special cases.

1085
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:17,085
So let's say Pips for heads.

1086
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:23,310
TS: What does that mean.

1087
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:27,050
CB: this is inaud English I think inaud

1088
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,310
If it has only now Jack, Queen and Ace.

1089
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,085
Let's say, if you get a Q card.

1090
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,450
then assign it the value of 12 explicitly.

1091
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,450
Let's start with a Jack, and that's an 11

1092
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,310
and then I have Queen and that's 12,

1093
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,600
and that's a King and that's 13

1094
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,170
and the Ace is 14.

1095
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:05,850
So this is number of Pips.

1096
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,620
I'm going to put it into a different variable.

1097
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,540
because this is getting too crowded.

1098
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,680
Number of Pips equals this now.

1099
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:17,970
TS: Right.

1100
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,740
Just to check I hav'nt done something stupid.

1101
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,420
There we go.

1102
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,800
So expected 12, got zero, perfect, so now

1103
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,820
what I want is 'check if
the beginning of that string

1104
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,910
is one of those special cases',

1105
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,740
otherwise you should just go with face value

1106
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,080
so I can have something like

1107
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,370
Pips for heads and dot fetch.

1108
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,970
This is what we said at the beginning,

1109
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,250
before I specified suit

1110
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,370
This is my Pips string.

1111
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,250
and this is what it looks like.

1112
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,850
I'm going to take Pips for
heads and I fetch my Pips string

1113
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,200
So, if it's in there inaud forward.

1114
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,140
and if it's not then I want it to fail gracefully

1115
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:20,740
and do this.

1116
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:23,050
Now, the issue with that is, for example

1117
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,280
if someone goes along the lines of

1118
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,310
entering a queen with a capital Q.

1119
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,020
That would not work

1120
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:33,280
It wI'll try to translate it.

1121
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,620
into an integer and that
would not work very nicely.

1122
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,650
If I want to do something foolproof

1123
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:46,220
I would put something along the lines of

1124
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,450
and by the way 'can you check that
the pip string only has digit's in it,

1125
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,820
before I cast it to an integer which wI'll save me the worry of

1126
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,850
how do I handle Queens -  a bit later on.

1127
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,680
TS: Are you worried about that ?

1128
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,480
CB: No. (laughter)

1129
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,570
If I was shipping this then yes, but no.

1130
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:14,570
This assumes correct
capitalisation, correct letters.

1131
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,600
all kinds of assumptions.

1132
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:23,080
and that's fine.

1133
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,940
I'm making that compromise for now

1134
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:28,800
because I don't think that's part
of the problem that I'm most interested in.

1135
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,080
So now we have a 'thing' and it parses queens

1136
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,420
12 of Diamonds and that's all working out fine

1137
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,080
Now, I've got my card values.

1138
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,400
Let's go back to our hand spec and see where

1139
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,020
that leaves us.

1140
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:46,310
TS:  Is your policy now
to implement ordinary straights

1141
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:49,400
or are you going straight for
the one that has an Ace in it ?

1142
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,200
CB: I'm going with an ordinary straight.

1143
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,510
So my straight hand in here just has....

1144
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,600
56789, which is quite reasonable.

1145
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,370
I've accidentally broken things because

1146
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:08,050
my straight is broken and
tells me that everything is fine.

1147
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,420
but now other tests are failing.

1148
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:17,820
inaud

1149
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,200
This is a more sensible place to be in

1150
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:26,400
I have assorted card values
and I want to look at each of the things

1151
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,940
They are in assorted order and I'm

1152
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:33,800
going to calculate the
difference between all of them

1153
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,880
If at the end I am in an array of only ones.

1154
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:39,940
I wI'll be quite happy.

1155
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:40,800
TS: I see.

1156
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,680
and if it's not then.... I'm not happy.

1157
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,000
So far so good

1158
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,200
I'm going to go for a naive implementation

1159
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:56,600
of this now because I don't
quite know where I'm going yet.

1160
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,080
I look at my card values.

1161
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,710
Actually that's not what I want to do.

1162
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,080
I want to know each of the decks

1163
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,800
because I want to know where I am in that inaud.

1164
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,400
I have my value and my index

1165
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:13,820
and I am looking at my assorted card value

1166
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:14,740
and what I want is....

1167
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,370
inaud

1168
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,828
and I want to compare it to the next card value

1169
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,510
So I want to compare those two values.

1170
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:31,850
and I only want to go....

1171
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,140
this is going to throw a very

1172
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,020
reached the end of the array situation.

1173
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,020
which is not where I want to be.

1174
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,800
This is sI'lly, I always have 5 cards, it's a hand

1175
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,280
so I'm going to put a magic number in there.

1176
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,450
I'm sorry.

1177
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:57,310
TS: No, no.

1178
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,857
This is the kind of thing that
you would have in productions

1179
01:18:05,857 --> 01:18:09,420
you have something that defines what 5 is somewhere and inaud

1180
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,540
So magic number 4

1181
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,740
Ok 5 inaud

1182
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,200
It is reasonable for me to say,

1183
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:26,140
and by the way do this 4 times.

1184
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:37,450
I need to start with an assumption inaud one

1185
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:40,820
and then I have some kind of integer.

1186
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:41,400
and then, Oh ....

1187
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,420
there's got to be a better way of doing this,

1188
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,800
but this is the first thing that comes to mind.

1189
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,110
So I'm looking at my sorted card values

1190
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:51,050
and also at my other sorted card value.

1191
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,820
This is it.

1192
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:57,940
Let's try something like

1193
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,220
this, the zero index, and

1194
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,000
TS: I see.

1195
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,400
So these two things I want to compare

1196
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,340
Just get rid of that

1197
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,850
I want the absolute difference between the two.

1198
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:19,340
They are sorted.

1199
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:26,800
What I want is ....

1200
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,110
So the first naive thing is...

1201
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,340
actually the result is ......

1202
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:48,220
inaud

1203
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,620
This is equals to one, so now

1204
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,880
This wI'll have to go somewhere else

1205
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,400
because it's getting verbose.

1206
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,510
What this chock of code is doing there is

1207
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,850
is saying difference between cards.

1208
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,400
And different Pips on a card.

1209
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:23,940
Dislike.

1210
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,970
TS: Yes, it's getting the value of that ....

1211
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,220
CB: Yes, I absolutely don't like this.

1212
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:37,850
For now inaud unnecessary.

1213
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,250
This should be the loop

1214
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,220
Let's get rid of that.

1215
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,910
A slightly misguided abstraction.

1216
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,370
If my difference between Pips is one,

1217
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:53,310
then I continue.

1218
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:55,685
Actually I don't like now I'm doing this

1219
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,170
inaud

1220
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:01,850
difference is always one.

1221
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,140
So what I want to do is say

1222
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,400
difference of one is true to start with

1223
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:14,570
and the second I get a difference is not

1224
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:16,970
one between the cards, I exit out of the loop

1225
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,000
and get out of there.

1226
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,940
So I start with true

1227
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,250
and while it's true

1228
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,570
And my index is below 4

1229
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:30,170
on sorted card values.count

1230
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,570
Magic number 4 that's fine.

1231
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,820
While difference is always one we do that.

1232
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:50,620
So if difference between Pips is that

1233
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,310
and difference is always one is ....

1234
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:58,250
and the new difference between Pips is one.inaud

1235
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,140
This we no longer need.

1236
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,540
Those we no longer need.

1237
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:07,680
This is called 'I' because I don't
want to remember all the variables.

1238
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:10,370
Where is my loops.

1239
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:13,740
And now what I want to do is....

1240
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,680
maybe initialise that,
that seems like a good idea.

1241
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:25,371
I stI'll haven't inaud zero

1242
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,771
I'm assuming that it is going to be a straight.

1243
01:22:28,771 --> 01:22:31,542
and then I continue until
something proves me wrong.

1244
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,820
so either I'm done with my calculation.

1245
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:37,940
or that's failed.

1246
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,340
So if it's not equal to one it should be false.

1247
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,480
inaud quite nice.

1248
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:45,910
So now, test tI'me.

1249
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,820
And now the computer fails (laughter).

1250
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,510
TS: It looks like it's got stuck in a loop

1251
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,970
CB: Maybe because I have an internet loop.

1252
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,880
I think I have an increment
in being dense, but there we go

1253
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,510
Every tI'me, just failing.

1254
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,710
This is now stI'll failing but this is ok

1255
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,140
StI'll seeing failure.

1256
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:27,085
So different strait.

1257
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,880
TS: When that loop finishes, how do you know

1258
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,880
whether or not it was a straight ?

1259
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:36,020
Ah ok.

1260
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:38,770
I'm missing a return value

1261
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,480
By the tI'me we get there, I want, if it's a straight

1262
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,600
to exit because of this failing.

1263
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,800
and then it should return the result.

1264
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:52,020
Which is stI'll wrong.

1265
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:53,820
Ok, so let's have a look.

1266
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:58,140
So I start an index here and as I go along

1267
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,200
my difference is....how have I sorted them....yes.

1268
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,970
I would do something naughty now

1269
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:13,970
print the thing out so I know

1270
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,170
where I'm heading.

1271
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,650
Iv'e got 56789 which seems 'straightish'

1272
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,820
Now let's walk through this

1273
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:24,480
So difference is always one is always true.

1274
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,650
While this is true,
the difference between Pips is

1275
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:29,770
this minus this

1276
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:31,110
this should be one

1277
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,480
inaud is one, this is

1278
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:34,820
It goes to one

1279
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,570
Yes, this returns as false.

1280
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:48,600
I'm going to run one test

1281
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:51,740
that one 5679

1282
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:55,280
and I'm going to shell out a few things.

1283
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,170
Because I don't know what's going on.

1284
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,370
TS: It looked like it passed there

1285
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,800
CB: Yes, this is why I'm a bit confused.

1286
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,280
TS: Is it a different test that's failing ?

1287
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,000
CB: Good point.

1288
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,280
Maybe one of my cases is actually a straight.

1289
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:15,770
Let's get rid of those

1290
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,970
I'm going to run this entire file

1291
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:20,910
and where is my failure.

1292
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,050
Should be a highest and it got a straight.

1293
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:30,510
Oh yes, one of my test cases inaud

1294
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:34,620
I'm feeling really clever
now because it enters a flush,

1295
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:41,310
but it's not a flush so it's not going to cause me inaud at any point then.

1296
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,400
Yes, it's all fine.

1297
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,080
TS: Great.

1298
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,170
I have an Ace which is a 14
but also a 1 when I want it to be

1299
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,140
So straight hand no Ace,
stI'll straight, same result.

1300
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,620
If we do this, and we have a hand parser.

1301
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,600
Actually, no we don't want to do that.

1302
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,970
We have an Ace now, we don't want a one.

1303
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:22,940
So we have 2345 and A.

1304
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:25,450
TS: Ok,

1305
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,310
The order doesn't matter

1306
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:33,600
CB: The order shouldn't matter
because I'm sorting them anyway.

1307
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:35,220
TS: So that's going to show up as

1308
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:37,250
just being a high card hand.
CB: Correct.

1309
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:40,370
This is showing up as a highest,
and I want it to be a straight.

1310
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,770
Let's go in there and implement that.

1311
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:47,940
This is a method that takes sorted card values

1312
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,880
then it can work out if it's a straight or not.

1313
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,510
Now if I have an Ace in my hand,

1314
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,480
I want it to work out, is this a straight if inaud 14 ?

1315
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,880
and is this a straight if it behaves like a one ?

1316
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,850
If this fails, if I treat my Ace
as a 14, then just do again with a one.

1317
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,000
let's extract that method out.

1318
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,650
and this takes an array of cards

1319
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:21,250
and determines if they are consecutive.

1320
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,540
So, consecutive cards

1321
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:38,570
This says my cards are consecutive.

1322
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:41,710
I don't like the fact that it's living here.

1323
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:44,742
This is just odd.

1324
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:55,220
If I had more time I would want to move this to inaud somewhere.

1325
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:57,880
This is a utility type function which has

1326
01:27:58,570 --> 01:27:59,820
no business being here.

1327
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,540
TS: Right. It doesn't need to be an instance method ?

1328
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,250
CB: it's got nothing to do with the hand.

1329
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,510
The concept of numbers being consecutive

1330
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,620
The hand needs it in order to rank it'self.

1331
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:16,540
but the actual
implementation of it does not live here.

1332
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,800
TS: It could be any numbers.

1333
01:28:18,850 --> 01:28:21,450
CB: Absolutely, it could
be just some random thing,

1334
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:25,850
That takes an array and
determines whether they are

1335
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,170
in some sort of nice order.

1336
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:27,850
TS: Ok.

1337
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:33,510
I'm just going to check that it is stI'll

1338
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:38,800
behaving nicely.

1339
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:50,510
In the case where sorted card values include

1340
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,000
the value 14, which is the Ace, I also want to

1341
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:58,880
change that array and do
the same thing with the one.

1342
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,770
and then check if it's a straight.

1343
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,310
So let's say assorted card values.

1344
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,140
I'm going to do something naive, if it includes 14

1345
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:29,450
This is where I want to know
what my array let's me do.

1346
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,450
No that's drop a certain number of things.

1347
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,680
I want to delete a thing from an array.

1348
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:47,970
inaud the array, documentation

1349
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,200
I do this all the tI'me.

1350
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,820
I have a bad memory
when it comes to remembering

1351
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:56,420
all the things.

1352
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,050
TS: it's probably inaud

1353
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:03,710
CB: Once you start programming
in more than three languages,

1354
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:05,280
it becomes a little difficult.

1355
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,020
TS: So you're going to
delete all of the 14s from the array ?

1356
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,740
CB: Yes, and I need to know
how many 14s I'm deleting

1357
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,140
That exact number of 1s on the other side

1358
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:22,740
otherwise I might end up with such
as an array and maybe three cards

1359
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:29,110
expecting a certain number of things in there

1360
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:30,910
remember my magic number in there.

1361
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:32,250
It would not be a good idea.

1362
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:42,250
delete 40.

1363
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,828
According to the Ruby
documentation this is deleted.

1364
01:30:56,342 --> 01:30:59,600
This gives me back all the
documentation that's it deleted.

1365
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:03,910
TS: It returns the last deleted item?

1366
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:06,770
CB:  Yes, but It doesn't tell me how many, interesting.

1367
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,540
I want to know how many 14s I have,

1368
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,220
so I want to count the number of things that match.

1369
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:26,740
How do I do that ?

1370
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,020
My implementation is this.

1371
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:40,110
This can go somewhere else,

1372
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,770
and be called what it actually is

1373
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,770
and if my number of Aces is bigger than one.

1374
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,970
then I want to delete all the Aces.

1375
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,970
and add two sorted card value once,

1376
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,970
but I want to do that
exactly the number of aces tI'mes.

1377
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,600
I could do it in a better way by concatulating

1378
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,480
two card values in an array of exactly

1379
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,540
the number of aces as ones.

1380
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,420
but let's leave that for now

1381
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:20,480
and let's check if things have gone wrong.

1382
01:32:21,885 --> 01:32:22,657
They have.

1383
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,250
This is terrible parenthesis use.

1384
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:33,400
because it turns out
blocks don't take round brackets.

1385
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:41,680
It's not working but it's not failing any more.

1386
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,370
TS: Is it because your
number of Aces is equal to one

1387
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:50,050
not greater than one ?

1388
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:56,370
CB: Yes, and there is also the fact that

1389
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:02,540
I think it's going to fail another way.

1390
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:05,600
And let me explain why,

1391
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:10,450
I think what I just wrote
is going to fail in the case of

1392
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:15,370
highest, because of how I've implemented it.

1393
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:20,540
To prove my point I'm going to write

1394
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:26,680
There we go inaud, high ace.

1395
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:33,450
What I mean by that... and do that.

1396
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,800
inaud add for array.  Interesting.

1397
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,540
TS: There are two failures,

1398
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,910
on both of those Ace tests.

1399
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:43,110
CB: Correct.

1400
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:47,650
So this is you cant inaud and insert. Yes.

1401
01:33:53,800 --> 01:34:01,170
inaud going in the loop which is good news.

1402
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:03,450
I want to find my inaud pass

1403
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,140
Let's de-bug our way through this

1404
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,220
It's happening on consecutive cards

1405
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:14,310
and it's happening on my eighty three

1406
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,650
Which is here.

1407
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,510
TS: What does the document for insert say ?

1408
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,620
CB: it's not destructive is it ?

1409
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:31,020
TS: it's not inaud the values with an index

1410
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,514
so you have to inaud an index.

1411
01:34:32,514 --> 01:34:33,228
CB: OK, alright.

1412
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,250
I'm going to insert it at the
start because it doesn't really matter

1413
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,910
Or I could go for the lazy option.

1414
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:58,800
TS: Has that fixed it.

1415
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,140
CB: No, so many things going wrong right now.

1416
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,220
This is take my sorted of card values and give me

1417
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,110
other possible card values for Aces.

1418
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:23,880
bit premature.

1419
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:28,570
If the number of Aces is bigger than one

1420
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:30,400
then I want to have ....

1421
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:36,800
Aces as ones.

1422
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,570
Which is just like sorted card values

1423
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,970
I want to manipulate that.

1424
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:49,140
TS: So your going to leave the original one alone.

1425
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:51,020
CB: Correct. I don't want to touch that.

1426
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:53,570
And then in the case
of straight I want to check

1427
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,250
either it works out fine
with the usual way of doing it.

1428
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,110
Or it works out with using
Ace as ones, way of doing it.

1429
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,110
So either is true.

1430
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,450
If the number of Aces is none

1431
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:21,020
then inaud usual check inaud cards.

1432
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:24,800
Now that's going to fail
nicely in places, excellent.

1433
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:29,740
It stI'll doesn't work with a straight with low ace.

1434
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:37,940
I want to check what my Aces as ones is like.

1435
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,540
This is my best chance of
understanding what's going on.

1436
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:46,710
Aces as ones looks like 123, aha !

1437
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:48,250
it's not sorted

1438
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:52,680
inaud sort here and I am doing

1439
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:53,400
my sort again.

1440
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:57,050
How about .... we just don't sort them here

1441
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:04,450
TS: And then consecutive cards
is going to be in charge of that.

1442
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:08,250
I'll give it any number of cards
in any odd number called card values

1443
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:13,400
and inside here my job is just to sort them.

1444
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:18,220
TS: Ok.

1445
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:20,850
And then go ahead with the rest of the code.

1446
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,770
Which I have changed variable names

1447
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:28,970
so it should be less angry at me.

1448
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:35,714
Good, strait inaud Aces straight pan Aces.

1449
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,250
TS: Ok so we are nearly out of tI'me now,
what would you like to do to wrap this up.

1450
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,020
I was going to run hand comparer, and about to write hand ranker,

1451
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,050
I'd like to try that out and see what happens

1452
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:54,220
TS: So ranking the hands you've inaud

1453
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,220
There are a few hands missing

1454
01:37:58,570 --> 01:38:00,080
but not a lot of work left to do.

1455
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,280
Let me just correct this

1456
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:13,050
inaud

1457
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:16,828
I've got a hand, it's told me what the rank it is

1458
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:19,020
but if I had two cards, I want to give my

1459
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,510
hand to my other hand and say

1460
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:23,540
Are you better than That hand.
TS: Ok.

1461
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:28,220
In my public interface with
my hand I would like to have

1462
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,940
is, better than other hand.

1463
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,280
TS: And it's going to return true or false.

1464
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,080
CB: Yes, exactly.

1465
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:40,340
How about we have a very quick,

1466
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,910
I wI'll describe 'better than'

1467
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,285
We can just say alright.

1468
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:56,280
It tells me if the hand is better

1469
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,480
We already have some very handy hands

1470
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,540
We know, for example, 4 of a kind hand

1471
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,310
It should be better than full house.

1472
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,600
let's start with those

1473
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:22,000
so full house dot better than 4 of a kind hand

1474
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:26,420
So I expect

1475
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:29,910
all of this to be true.

1476
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,080
TS: Is that the right way round?

1477
01:39:37,850 --> 01:39:39,770
A full house is better than 4 of a kind.

1478
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:40,910
CB: No it's not - thank you.

1479
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:46,740
That looks more sensible.

1480
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:50,650
Let's run this.

1481
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,910
I want to find a 'better than' for hand

1482
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,170
Oh that's because I've
implemented it as a Poker method

1483
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:00,450
let's run this

1484
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,710
and now it's inaud excellent

1485
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:07,710
So I have the rank of both hands
and I want to know which is the better.

1486
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,820
This comes back to the thing

1487
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,820
which I was thinking about an hour ago.

1488
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:20,820
If only I'd known there was a
ranking that told me the best hand.

1489
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:25,110
and next possible best hand.

1490
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,600
So this is what we want.

1491
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:29,740
If we have big poker ranks

1492
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,420
and it's an array and ordered thing for now.

1493
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,680
and if we go forward and say.....

1494
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,770
this is a naive implementation

1495
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,510
So if we have 4 of a kind, full house and straight.

1496
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:56,110
What I could do is inaud

1497
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:59,310
I can just get the index of rank

1498
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,420
and compare that to the Poker rank.

1499
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:05,280
index of the other hand

1500
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:09,220
and that would give me a straightforward answer for inaud

1501
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:15,740
I'm assuming that the
index is here, I'm not really sure

1502
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:21,250
This is me, this is my rank, and this is confusing.

1503
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:28,050
TS: Your putting the worst first

1504
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:31,850
CB: Yes because inaud

1505
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,680
And if it's a high rank inaud happier with it.

1506
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:38,050
TS: The the question wI'll
be is my index greater than

1507
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:43,620
CB: Yes and I am going to
say it's strictly greater than

1508
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:45,220
I'll get back to that in a second

1509
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:51,450
inaud index doesn't exist obviously

1510
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:54,910
Let's now assume if we have some method on the array

1511
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,220
That is find index, that's the
one I probably want, is it ?

1512
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,310
Yes, it returns the index of a thing,

1513
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:10,420
so just index would have worked better.

1514
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,310
Let's go back here

1515
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:25,220
Go and define method inaud. excellent.

1516
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,910
This is apparently nil.

1517
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:38,850
TS: Because it was not
finding the rank in that array.

1518
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:39,450
CB: Correct.

1519
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:50,800
I am comparing four of a kind and full house.

1520
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:58,050
I'm going to print out the
rank of the other hands because

1521
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:03,710
I'm running out of tI'me so I don't want to spend ages

1522
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,420
debugging this. Oh of course it's a hash.

1523
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:16,480
So I'm not comparing that,
I'm just assuming there is a type.

1524
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:21,820
If there is a type then I should
be wary so I'm going to let that fail.

1525
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,800
And we have no failures.

1526
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:29,200
Now we can compare two hands.

1527
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,220
There is a tiny bit of work left

1528
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,740
there's a few hands I haven't implemented.

1529
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:36,970
And there's a bit of work left in terms of:

1530
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:41,050
we'll, we should probably
have all the rankings in nice order.

1531
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:43,140
Theres an obvious re-factoring step

1532
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:45,770
which is, we'll now I have a list of things.

1533
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:48,510
that rank things and then

1534
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:53,570
my rank method is executing
and checking for things in a certain order.

1535
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:59,510
The order that I'm defining in this inaud array

1536
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:03,200
Is the exact same one which I want to be ranking those cards

1537
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,540
so I should be something really clever here.

1538
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,710
The big piece of functionality that's missing is

1539
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:14,280
If I have two straights, how do I know who has one.

1540
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:17,940
and this is why I'm returning
this rank as type something

1541
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,820
because I had in mind, I
don't only care about the type of hand

1542
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:26,371
I also care about the highest card in that hand

1543
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:31,280
For a straight for example,
I would get the highest card

1544
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:34,280
in that hand

1545
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:37,170
With the mix of Ace should be counted as 1 or 14

1546
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:42,650
depending on the kind of straight that I have.

1547
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,570
and I would return that as inaud rank.

1548
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:48,740
and if my rank method gives
me back not just the type of my hand

1549
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:51,200
but also the highest possible tie breaker

1550
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,110
in some hands than others it's different things,

1551
01:44:57,620 --> 01:45:00,570
then I can definitely determine
if my hand has won or not.

1552
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:02,050
TS: Ok, great.

1553
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:05,400
TS: we'll I think that would
be a good place to wrap it up.

1554
01:45:05,650 --> 01:45:08,170
Thank  you very much
for showing us this today

1555
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:10,280
It's been fascinating watching you work.

1556
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,770
So again, thank you very much.

1557
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:12,540
CB: Thanks.
